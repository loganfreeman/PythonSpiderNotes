You will manage to complete an important project and will already start thinking about a new one. Your family might feel upset with your plans. You are advised to shorten the long working hours. You may want to pay more attention to your loved ones. You don't want to upset your significant other, do you. Red flags? Your rose-colored glasses could screen them out today, thanks to a moon-Neptune trine. That ability to see the best in people is a beautiful thing, Sagittarius, but don't let this blind you to their flaws and human foibles. At the end of the day, no mere mortal should be vaulted up on the pedestal. Let relationships unfold organically with an understanding that even the best people out there have a shadow side. The question really is: can you love them for better AND for worse?Today you are caught between your desire to inform people of the facts they are missing and your duty to remain quiet and do as you are told. Sometimes life seems difficult because you think you know more than you should. Becoming a whistleblower may be the morally correct action, but it might also make life more stressful on the job. Do what it takes to thrive, yet keep in mind that harsh practicality can outweigh even your most altruistic ideals.Your sense of justice may be offended at first today, but you can bring the situation back into balance if you are direct and speak plainly to the right people. Keep pushing for what you believe!
