With an improved budget, you intend to leave on a trip and pay a visit to relatives. Before you leave, you'd better check whether you will find them at home! In the afternoon you could experience minor health problems. Don't worry! It's nothing a short diet can't fix. You will feel much better tomorrow. Someone's been clamoring for your attention, Virgo. Slow down and stop missing those obvious clues and cues. People don't persistently show up to spend time with you unless they're at least a little bit interested in getting to know you better&#x2014;or what's more likely the case, burning with desire for you. If you're already spoken for, a conversation may be needed to clear up any blurred lines. Refusing to address the attraction is a bit like playing Russian roulette with the relationship. Speak now and stop a runaway love train in its tracks.Your intuition may lead you to the conclusion that you will soon be encountering complex situations involving others. However, you aren't ready to turn your life upside down yet. In fact, you might try to minimize your current frustration by avoiding meaningful discussions about issues that have no immediate solutions. Unfortunately, this delaying tactic won't necessarily work now. Thankfully, you can still delve into a relationship dilemma without making matters worse as long as you postpone any long-lasting decisions until after the new year.Reflect on your values and what they mean to you -- and to others. Your mental energy turns inward somewhat today, and that's a good thing. You may have an important epiphany tonight.
