You will be making preparations to leave on a short vacation. Consider the advice offered by an older person in the family! In the evening you will be invited to a party. You are advised to decline the invitation, for you must be fresh tommorow morning. Check your luggage and papers thoroughly! Today, feel free to make mountains out of molehills, Cancer. A flamboyant trine between the moon and Neptune fuels the day with fantasy and excitement. You're the Pied Piper among your friends; the person who ratchets the average experience up to a higher altitude so that everyone is clamoring to join in. Whether you're hosting a game night or setting the itinerary for an epic night on the town (costumes optional), you're in command of the fun factor, Cancer. Don't let the naysayers rain on your parade! With a little coaxing, they'll let their hair down too.Naturally, you want to put your best foot forward today, but some things are not as rosy as they appear. Unfortunately, you could channel so much of your energy into presenting a cheerful face that you end up exhausting yourself trying to look good. Keeping up appearances is just not worth the effort if you end up so depleted that you can't enjoy yourself later on. Happily, you don't have to pretend for everyone; your true friends will accept you just the way you are.Take it in stride when things start to get prickly this morning. Remember that it's not about you, and you may find that you are the best one suited to restore domestic bliss. It may take a while!
