You are advised not to get involved in business activities today, for unexpected events may occur. You may learn about the bad health condition of a close relative. You will have to make several short trips and spend a lot of money. If you don't have enough money, you can ask your friends for help. Individualist Aries, on the average day you prefer well-defined personal space and boundaries. Today is different. A moon-Neptune trine softens your restrictions and may even blur a few lines. Head's up: there's a quality of fantasy involved in today's events, which makes them more ephemeral than permanent. Lose yourself in today's fascinations but don't compromise your values or flake on any commitments that you've already made to other people.Thinking about ways to improve a current relationship today won't necessarily make it any better, but it might be a great first step. Finding a course of action may seem hopeless when you consider all the work you must do to reach your goals and get what you want. Don't be so hard on yourself or someone you love; instead, try revising your expectations. You could be closer to satisfaction than you realize if you simply shift your attitude.You are feeling the holiday spirit still -- so get out there and volunteer, or at least lift the spirits of someone close who's got the blues. The karma you earn is just the icing on the cake!
