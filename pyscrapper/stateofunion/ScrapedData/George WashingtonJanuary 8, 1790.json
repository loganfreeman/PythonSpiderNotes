    "speech": "Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:I embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents itself\nof congratulating you on the present favorable prospects of our public\naffairs. The recent accession of the important state of North Carolina to\nthe Constitution of the United States (of which official information has\nbeen received), the rising credit and respectability of our country, the\ngeneral and increasing good will toward the government of the Union, and\nthe concord, peace, and plenty with which we are blessed are circumstances\nauspicious in an eminent degree to our national prosperity.In resuming your consultations for the general good you can not but derive\nencouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last session\nhave been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty and\ndifficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their\nexpectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious Providence has\nplaced within our reach will in the course of the present important session\ncall for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism, firmness, and\nwisdom.Among the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that of\nproviding for the common defense will merit particular regard. To be\nprepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a\nuniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest\nrequire that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them\nindependent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.The proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable\nwill be entitled to mature consideration. In the arrangements which may be\nmade respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable\nsupport of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to economy.There was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to\ncertain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the inhabitants of\nour southern and western frontiers from their depredations, but you will\nperceive from the information contained in the papers which I shall direct\nto be laid before you (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth\nof Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those\nparts of the Union, and, if necessary, to punish aggressors.The interests of the United States require that our intercourse with other\nnations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable me to\nfulfill my duty in that respect in the manner which circumstances may\nrender most conducive to the public good, and to this end that the\ncompensation to be made to the persons who may be employed should,\naccording to the nature of their appointments, be defined by law, and a\ncompetent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the\nconduct of foreign affairs.Various considerations also render it expedient that the terms on which\nforeigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens should be speedily\nascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization.Uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is\nan object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended\nto.The advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures by all proper\nmeans will not, I trust, need recommendation; but I can not forbear\nintimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well\nto the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the\nexertions of skill and genius in producing them at home, and of\nfacilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by a\ndue attention to the post-office and post-roads.Nor am I less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that there\nis nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of\nscience and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of\npublic happiness. In one in which the measures of government receive their\nimpressions so immediately from the sense of the community as in ours it is\nproportionably essential.To the security of a free constitution it contributes in various ways--by\nconvincing those who are intrusted with the public administration that\nevery valuable end of government is best answered by the enlightened\nconfidence of the people, and by teaching the people themselves to know and\nto value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions of\nthem; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of\nlawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their\nconvenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society;\nto discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness--\ncherishing the first, avoiding the last--and uniting a speedy but\ntemperate vigilance against encroachments, with an inviolable respect to\nthe laws.Whether this desirable object will be best promoted by affording aids to\nseminaries of learning already established, by the institution of a\nnational university, or by any other expedients will be well worthy of a\nplace in the deliberations of the legislature.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:I saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the\nresolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an adequate\nprovision for the support of the public credit is a matter of high\nimportance to the national honor and prosperity. In this sentiment I\nentirely concur; and to a perfect confidence in your best endeavors to\ndevise such a provision as will be truly with the end I add an equal\nreliance on the cheerful cooperation of the other branch of the\nlegislature.It would be superfluous to specify inducements to a measure in which the\ncharacter and interests of the United States are so obviously so deeply\nconcerned, and which has received so explicit a sanction from your\ndeclaration.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:I have directed the proper officers to lay before you, respectively, such\npapers and estimates as regard the affairs particularly recommended to your\nconsideration, and necessary to convey to you that information of the state\nof the Union which it is my duty to afford.The welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and\nefforts ought to be directed, and I shall derive great satisfaction from a\ncooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our\nfellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a\nfree, efficient, and equal government.",
