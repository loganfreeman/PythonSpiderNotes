    "speech": "To the Congress of the United States:Mr. Speaker, Mr. President pro tempore, Members of Congress, and fellow\nAmericans:In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the\nstate of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been\ndelivered by the American people.We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save\nothers on the groundpassengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer.\nPlease help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight.We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past\nexhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the\ngiving of blood, the saying of prayersin English, Hebrew, and Arabic.We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people, who have made the grief\nof strangers their own.My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself\nthe state of our Unionand it is strong.Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our\ngrief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies\nto justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. I thank the\nCongress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was\ntouched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats, joined\ntogether on the steps of this Capitol, singing God Bless America. And you\ndid more than sing, you acted, by delivering forty billion dollars to rebuild\nour communities and meet the needs of our military.Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle, and\nSenator Lott, I thank you for your friendship and your leadership and your\nservice to our country. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world\nfor its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our\nNational Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, and on the streets of Paris, and\nat Berlins Brandenburg Gate. We will not forget South Korean children gathering\nto pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a\nmosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in\nAustralia and Africa and Latin America.Nor will we forget the citizens of eighty other nations who died with our own.\nDozens of Pakistanis. More than 130 Israelis. More than 250 citizens of India.\nMen and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico, and Japan. And hundreds of British\ncitizens. America has no truer friend than Great Britain. Once again, we are\njoined together in a great cause. The British Prime Minister has crossed an\nocean to show his unity of purpose with America, and tonight we welcome Tony\nBlair.On September the eleventh, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against\nour country. Americans have known warsbut for the past 136 years, they have\nbeen wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known\nthe casualties of warbut not at the center of a great city on a peaceful\nmorning. Americans have known surprise attacksbut never before on thousands of\ncivilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single dayand night fell on a\ndifferent world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who attacked our\ncountry?The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated\nterrorist organizations known as al-Qaida. They are the same murderers indicted\nfor bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for the\nbombing of the U.S.S. Cole.Al-Qaida is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making\nmoney; its goal is remaking the worldand imposing its radical beliefs on people\neverywhere.The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been\nrejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clericsa fringe\nmovement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists\ndirective commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and\nmake no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children.This group and its leadersa person named Usama bin Ladinare linked to many\nother organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad\nand the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.There are thousands of these terrorists in more than sixty countries. They are\nrecruited from their own nations and neighborhoods, and brought to camps in\nplaces like Afghanistan where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They\nare sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to\nplot evil and destruction.The leadership of al-Qaida has great influence in Afghanistan, and supports the\nTaliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we see\nal-Qaidas vision for the world. Afghanistans people have been brutalized many\nare starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can\nbe jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their\nleaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long\nenough.The United States respects the people of Afghanistanafter all, we are currently\nits largest source of humanitarian aidbut we condemn the Taliban regime. It is\nnot only repressing its own people, it is threatening people everywhere by\nsponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting\nmurder, the Taliban regime is committing murder. And tonight, the United States\nof America makes the following demands on the Taliban:Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al-Qaida who hide in\nyour land.Release all foreign nationalsincluding American citizensyou have unjustly\nimprisoned, and protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers in your\ncountry.Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan\nand hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to\nappropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to terrorist\ntraining camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating. These demands\nare not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act and act\nimmediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their\nfate.I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world: We\nrespect your faith. It is practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and by\nmillions more in countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are\ngood and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the\nname of Allah. The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in\neffect, to hijack Islam itself.The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab\nfriends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that\nsupports them.Our war on terror with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end\nuntil every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and\ndefeated. Americans are asking: Why do they hate us?They hate what we see right here in this chambera democratically elected\ngovernment. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedomsour freedom\nof religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and\ndisagree with each other. They want to overthrow existing governments in many\nMuslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive\nIsrael out of the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of\nvast regions of Asia and Africa.These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of\nlife. With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from\nthe world and forsaking our friends. They stand against us, because we stand in\ntheir way.We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before.\nThey are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the twentieth century. By\nsacrificing human life to serve their radical visionsby abandoning every value\nexcept the will to powerthey follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and\ntotalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends:\nin historys unmarked grave of discarded lies.Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war?We will direct every resource at our commandevery means of diplomacy, every\ntool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial\ninfluence, and every necessary weapon of warto the disruption and defeat of the\nglobal terror network. This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade\nago, with its decisive liberation of territory and its swift conclusion. It will\nnot look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops\nwere used and not a single American was lost in combat.Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes.\nAmericans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other\nwe have seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on television, and covert\noperations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn\nthem one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no\nrefuge or rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to\nterrorism.Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with\nus, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that\ncontinues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States\nas a hostile regime.Our Nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We will take\ndefensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today, dozens of\nFederal departments and agencies, as well as State and local governments, have\nresponsibilities affecting homeland security.These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight I announce\nthe creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to methe Office of\nHomeland Security. And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead\nthis effort to strengthen Americas securitya military veteran, an effective\nGovernor, a true patriot, and my trusted friend, Pennsylvanias Governor Tom\nRidge. He will lead, oversee, and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy\nto safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to any attacks that may\ncome.These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat\nto our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives\nto the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and all\nhave our prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a\nmessage for our military: Be ready. I have called the armed forces to alert, and\nthere is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make\nus proud.This is not, however, just Americas fight. And what is at stake is not just\nAmericas freedom. This is the worlds fight. This is civilizations fight. This\nis the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and\nfreedom.We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the help of\npolice forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world. The\nUnited States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations\nhave already respondedwith sympathy and with support. Nations from Latin\nAmerica, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO\nCharter reflects best the attitude of the world: an attack on one is an attack\non all.The civilized world is rallying to Americas side. They understand that if this\nterror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next.\nTerror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the\nstability of legitimate governments. And we will not allow it.Americans are asking: What is expected of us?I ask you to live your lives and hug your children. I know many citizens have\nfears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a\ncontinuing threat.I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come\nhere. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to\nlive by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words\nbecause of their ethnic background or religious faith.I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your\ncontributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information,\nlibertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New\nYork, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The thousands of FBI agents who are now at\nwork in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it.I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany\ntighter securityand for your patience in what will be a long struggle.I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy.\nTerrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its\nsource. America is successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and\nenterprise of our people.These were the true strengths of our economy before September eleventh, and they\nare our strengths today. Finally, please continue praying for the victims of\nterror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country.\nPrayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey\nahead.Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what\nyou will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their\nrepresentatives, for what you have already done, and for what we will do\ntogether.Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to\nimprove air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on\ndomestic flights, and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come\ntogether to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with direct\nassistance during this emergency. We will come together to give law enforcement\nthe additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. We will come\ntogether to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of\nterrorists before they act, and find them before they strike. We will come\ntogether to take active steps that strengthen Americas economy, and put our\npeople back to work.Tonight we welcome here two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all\nNew Yorkers: Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudy Giuliani. As a symbol of\nAmericas resolve, my Administration will work with the Congress, and these two\nleaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.After all that has just passedall the lives taken, and all the possibilities\nand hopes that died with themit is natural to wonder if Americas future is one\nof fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead, and\ndangers to face. But this country will define our times, not be defined by them.\nAs long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not\nbe an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief\nand anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war.\nThe advance of human freedomthe great achievement of our time, and the great\nhope of every timenow depends on us. Our Nation this generationwill lift a\ndark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world\nto this cause, by our efforts and by our courage. We will not tire, we will not\nfalter, and we will not fail.It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to\nnormal. Well go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. Even grief\nrecedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will\nremember what happened that day, and to whom it happened. We will remember the\nmoment the news camewhere we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an\nimage of fire, or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a\nvoice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man\nnamed George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others.\nIt was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. This is\nmy reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end.I will not forget this wound to our country, or those who inflicted it. I will\nnot yieldI will not restI will not relent in waging this struggle for the\nfreedom and security of the American people.The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom\nand fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is\nnot neutral between them.Fellow citizens, we will meet violence with patient justiceassured of the\nrightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies\nbefore us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of\nAmerica.Thank you.GEORGE W. BUSH.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, September 20, 2001.",
