    "date": "January 7, 1954", 
    "speech": "Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Eighty-third Congress:It is a high honor again to present to the Congress my views on the state\nof the Union and to recommend measures to advance the security, prosperity,\nand well-being of the American people.All branches of this Government--and I venture to say both of our great\nparties--can support the general objective of the recommendations I make\ntoday, for that objective is the building of a stronger America. A nation\nwhose every citizen has good reason for bold hope; where effort is rewarded\nand prosperity is shared; where freedom expands and peace is secure--that\nis what I mean by a stronger America.Toward this objective a real momentum has been developed during this\nAdministration's first year in office. We mean to continue that momentum\nand to increase it. We mean to build a better future for this nation.Much for which we may be thankful has happened during the past year.First of all we are deeply grateful that our sons no longer die on the\ndistant mountains of Korea. Although they are still called from our homes\nto military service, they are no longer called to the field of battle.The nation has just completed the most prosperous year in its history. The\ndamaging effect of inflation on the wages, pensions, salaries and savings\nof us all has been brought under control. Taxes have begun to go down. The\ncost of our government has been reduced and its work proceeds with some\n183,000 fewer employees; thus the discouraging trend of modern governments\ntoward their own limitless expansion has in our case been reversed. The\ncost of armaments becomes less oppressive as we near our defense goals; yet\nwe are militarily stronger every day. During the year, creation of the new\nCabinet Department of Health, Education, and Welfare symbolized the\ngovernment's permanent concern with the human problems of our citizens.Segregation in the armed forces and other Federal activities is on the way\nout. We have also made progress toward its elimination in the District of\nColumbia. These are steps in the continuing effort to eliminate\ninter-racial difficulty.Some developments beyond our shores have been equally encouraging.\nCommunist aggression, halted in Korea, continues to meet in Indo-china the\nvigorous resistance of France and the Associated States, assisted by timely\naid from our country. In West Germany, in Iran, and in other areas of the\nworld, heartening political victories have been won by the forces of\nstability and freedom. Slowly but surely, the free world gathers strength.\nMeanwhile, from behind the iron curtain, there are signs that tyranny is in\ntrouble and reminders that its structure is as brittle as its surface is\nhard.There has been in fact a great strategic change in the world during the\npast year. That precious intangible, the initiative, is becoming ours. Our\npolicy, not limited to mere reaction against crises provoked by others, is\nfree to develop along lines of our choice not only abroad, but also at\nhome. As a major theme for American policy during the coming year, let our\njoint determination be to hold this new initiative and to use it.We shall use this initiative to promote three broad purposes: First, to\nprotect the freedom of our people; second, to maintain a strong, growing\neconomy; third, to concern ourselves with the human problems of the\nindividual citizen.Only by active concern for each of these purposes can we be sure that we\nare on the forward road to a better and a stronger America. All my\nrecommendations today are in furtherance of these three purposes.I. FOREIGN AFFAIRSAmerican freedom is threatened so long as the world Communist conspiracy\nexists in its present scope, power and hostility. More closely than ever\nbefore, American freedom is interlocked with the freedom of other people.\nIn the unity of the free world lies our best chance to reduce the Communist\nthreat without war. In the task of maintaining this unity and strengthening\nall its parts, the greatest responsibility falls naturally on those who,\nlike ourselves, retain the most freedom and strength.We shall, therefore, continue to advance the cause of freedom on foreign\nfronts.In the Far East, we retain our vital interest in Korea. We have negotiated\nwith the Republic of Korea a mutual security pact, which develops our\nsecurity system for the Pacific and which I shall promptly submit to the\nSenate for its consent to ratification. We are prepared to meet any renewal\nof armed aggression in Korea. We shall maintain indefinitely our bases in\nOkinawa. I shall ask the Congress to authorize continued material\nassistance to hasten the successful conclusion of the struggle in\nIndo-china. This assistance will also bring closer the day when the\nAssociated States may enjoy the independence already assured by France. We\nshall also continue military and economic aid to the Nationalist Government\nof China.In South Asia, profound changes are taking place in free nations which are\ndemonstrating their ability to progress through democratic methods. They\nprovide an inspiring contrast to the dictatorial methods and backward\ncourse of events in Communist China. In these continuing efforts, the free\npeoples of South Asia can be assured of the support of the United States.In the Middle East, where tensions and serious problems exist, we will show\nsympathetic and impartial friendship.In Western Europe our policy rests firmly on the North Atlantic Treaty. It\nwill remain so based as far ahead as we can see. Within its organization,\nthe building of a united European community, including France and Germany,\nis vital to a free and self-reliant Europe. This will be promoted by the\nEuropean Defense Community which offers assurance of European security.\nWith the coming of unity to Western Europe, the assistance this Nation can\nrender for the security of Europe and the free world will be multiplied in\neffectiveness.In the Western Hemisphere we shall continue to develop harmonious and\nmutually beneficial cooperation with our neighbors. Indeed, solid\nfriendship with all our American neighbors is a cornerstone of our entire\npolicy.In the world as a whole, the United Nations, admittedly still in a state of\nevolution, means much to the United States. It has given uniquely valuable\nservices in many places where violence threatened. It is the only real\nworld forum where we have the opportunity for international presentation\nand rebuttal. It is a place where the nations of the world can, if they\nhave the will, take collective action for peace and justice. It is a place\nwhere the guilt can be squarely assigned to those who fail to take all\nnecessary steps to keep the peace. The United Nations deserves our\ncontinued firm support.FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND TRADEIn the practical application of our foreign policy, we enter the field of\nforeign assistance and trade.Military assistance must be continued. Technical assistance must be\nmaintained. Economic assistance can be reduced. However, our economic\nprograms in Korea and in a few other critical places of the world are\nespecially important, and I shall ask Congress to continue them in the next\nfiscal year.The forthcoming Budget Message will propose maintenance of the Presidential\npower of transferability of all assistance funds and will ask authority to\nmerge these funds with the regular defense funds. It will also propose that\nthe Secretary of Defense have primary responsibility for the administration\nof foreign military assistance in accordance with the policy guidance of\nthe Secretary of State.The fact that we can now reduce our foreign economic assistance in many\nareas is gratifying evidence that its objectives are being achieved. By\ncontinuing to surpass her prewar levels of economic activity, Western\nEurope gains self-reliance. Thus our relationship enters a new phase which\ncan bring results beneficial to our taxpayers and our allies alike, if\nstill another step is taken.This step is the creation of a healthier and freer system of trade and\npayments within the free world--a system in which our allies can earn their\nown way and our own economy can continue to flourish. The free world can no\nlonger afford the kinds of arbitrary restraints on trade that have\ncontinued ever since the war. On this problem I shall submit to the\nCongress detailed recommendations, after our Joint Commission on Foreign\nEconomic Policy has made its report.ATOMIC ENERGY PROPOSALAs we maintain our military strength during the coming year and draw closer\nthe bonds with our allies, we shall be in an improved position to discuss\noutstanding issues with the Soviet Union. Indeed we shall be glad to do so\nwhenever there is a reasonable prospect of constructive results. In this\nspirit the atomic energy proposals of the United States were recently\npresented to the United Nations General Assembly. A truly constructive\nSoviet reaction will make possible a new start toward an era of peace, and\naway from the fatal road toward atomic war.DEFENSESince our hope is peace, we owe ourselves and the world a candid\nexplanation of the military measures we are taking to make that peace\nsecure.As we enter this new year, our military power continues to grow. This power\nis for our own defense and to deter aggression. We shall not be aggressors,\nbut we and our allies have and will maintain a massive capability to strike\nback.Here are some of the considerations in our defense planning:First, while determined to use atomic power to serve the usages of peace,\nwe take into full account our great and growing number of nuclear weapons\nand the most effective means of using them against an aggressor if they are\nneeded to preserve our freedom. Our defense will be stronger if, under\nappropriate security safeguards, we share with our allies certain knowledge\nof the tactical use of our nuclear weapons. I urge the Congress to provide\nthe needed authority.Second, the usefulness of these new weapons creates new relationships\nbetween men and materials. These new relationships permit economies in the\nuse of men as we build forces suited to our situation in the world today.\nAs will be seen from the Budget Message on January 21, the airpower of our\nNavy and Air Force is receiving heavy emphasis.Third, our armed forces must regain maximum mobility of action. Our\nstrategic reserves must be centrally placed and readily deployable to meet\nsudden aggression against ourselves and our allies.Fourth, our defense must rest on trained manpower and its most economical\nand mobile use. A professional corps is the heart of any security\norganization. It is necessarily the teacher and leader of those who serve\ntemporarily in the discharge of the obligation to help defend the Republic.\nPay alone will not retain in the career service of our armed forces the\nnecessary numbers of long-term personnel. I strongly urge, therefore, a\nmore generous use of other benefits important to service morale. Among\nthese are more adequate living quarters and family housing units and\nmedical care for dependents.Studies of military manpower have just been completed by the National\nSecurity Training Commission and a Committee appointed by the Director of\nthe Office of Defense Mobilization. Evident weaknesses exist in the state\nof readiness and organization of our reserve forces. Measures to correct\nthese weaknesses will be later submitted to the Congress.Fifth, the ability to convert swiftly from partial to all-out mobilization\nis imperative to our security. For the first time, mobilization officials\nknow what the requirements are for 1,000 major items needed for military\nuses. These data, now being related to civilian requirements and our supply\npotential, will show us the gaps in our mobilization base. Thus we shall\nhave more realistic plant-expansion and stockpiling goals. We shall speed\ntheir attainment. This Nation is at last to have an up-to-date mobilization\nbase--the foundation of a sound defense program.Another part of this foundation is, of course, our continental transport\nsystem. Some of our vital heavy materials come increasingly from Canada.\nIndeed our relations with Canada, happily always close, involve more and\nmore the unbreakable ties of strategic interdependence. Both nations now\nneed the St. Lawrence Seaway for security as well as for economic reasons.\nI urge the Congress promptly to approve our participation in its\nconstruction.Sixth, military and non-military measures for continental defense must be\nand are being strengthened. In the current fiscal year we are allocating to\nthese purposes an increasing portion of our effort, and in the next fiscal\nyear we shall spend nearly a billion dollars more for them than in 1953.An indispensable part of our continental security is our civil defense\neffort. This will succeed only as we have the complete cooperation of State\nGovernors, Mayors, and voluntary citizen groups. With their help we can\nadvance a cooperative program which, if an attack should come, would save\nmany lives and lessen destruction.The defense program recommended in the 1955 Budget is consistent with all\nof the considerations which I have just discussed. It is based on a new\nmilitary program unanimously recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and\napproved by me following consideration by the National Security Council.\nThis new program will make and keep America strong in an age of peril.\nNothing should bar its attainment.The international and defense policies which I have outlined will enable us\nto negotiate from a position of strength as we hold our resolute course\ntoward a peaceful world. We now turn to matters which are normally\ncharacterized as domestic, well realizing that what we do abroad affects\nevery problem at home--from the amount of taxes to our very state of mind.INTERNAL SECURITYUnder the standards established for the new employee security program, more\nthan 2,200 employees have been separated from the Federal government. Our\nnational security demands that the investigation of new employees and the\nevaluation of derogatory information respecting present employees be\nexpedited and concluded at the earliest possible date. I shall recommend\nthat the Congress provide additional funds where necessary to speed these\nimportant procedures.From the special employment standards of the Federal government I turn now\nto a matter relating to American citizenship. The subversive character of\nthe Communist Party in the United States has been clearly demonstrated in\nmany ways, including court proceedings. We should recognize by law a fact\nthat is plain to all thoughtful citizens-that we are dealing here with\nactions akin to treason--that when a citizen knowingly participates in the\nCommunist conspiracy he no longer holds allegiance to the United States.I recommend that Congress enact legislation to provide that a citizen of\nthe United States who is convicted in the courts of hereafter conspiring to\nadvocate the overthrow of this government by force or violence be treated\nas having, by such act, renounced his allegiance to the United States and\nforfeited his United States citizenship.In addition, the Attorney General will soon appear before your Committees\nto present his recommendations for needed additional legal weapons with\nwhich to combat subversion in our country and to deal with the question of\nclaimed immunity.II. STRONG ECONOMYI turn now to the second great purpose of our government: Along with the\nprotection of freedom, the maintenance of a strong and growing economy.The American economy is one of the wonders of the world. It undergirds our\ninternational position, our military security, and the standard of living\nof every citizen. This Administration is determined to keep our economy\nstrong and to keep it growing.At this moment we are in transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.\nI am confident that we can complete this transition without serious\ninterruption in our economic growth. But we shall not leave this vital\nmatter to chance. Economic preparedness is fully as important to the nation\nas military preparedness.Subsequent special messages and the economic report on January 28 will set\nforth plans of the Administration and its recommendations for Congressional\naction. These will include flexible credit and debt management policies;\ntax measures to stimulate consumer and business spending; suitable lending,\nguaranteeing, insuring, and grant-in-aid activities; strengthened old-age\nand unemployment insurance measures; improved agricultural programs;\npublic-works plans laid well in advance; enlarged opportunities for\ninternational trade and investment. This mere enumeration of these subjects\nimplies the vast amount of study, coordination, and planning, to say\nnothing of authorizing legislation, that altogether make our economic\npreparedness complete.If new conditions arise that require additional administrative or\nlegislative action, the Administration will still be ready. A government\nalways ready, as this is, to take well-timed and vigorous action, and a\nbusiness community willing, as ours is, to plan boldly and with\nconfidence, can between them develop a climate assuring steady economic\ngrowth.THE BUDGETI shall submit to the Congress on January 21 the first budget prepared by\nthis Administration, for the period July 1, 1954, through June 1955. This\nbudget is adequate to the current needs of the government. It recognizes\nthat a Federal budget should be a stabilizing factor in the economy. Its\ntax and expenditure programs will foster individual initiative and economic\ngrowth.Pending the transmittal of my Budget Message, I shall mention here only a\nfew points about our budgetary situation.First, one of our initial acts was to revise, with the cooperation of the\nCongress, the Budget prepared before this Administration took office.\nRequests for new appropriations were greatly reduced. In addition, the\nspending level provided in that Budget for the current fiscal year has been\nreduced by about $7,000,000,000. In the next fiscal year we estimate a\nfurther reduction in expenditures of more than $5,000,000,000. This will\nreduce the spending level over the two fiscal years by more than\n$12,000,000,000. We are also reducing further our requests for new\nappropriations.Second, despite the substantial loss of revenue in the coming fiscal year,\nresulting from tax reductions now in effect and tax adjustments which I\nshall propose, our reduced spending will move the new budget closer to a\nbalance.Third, by keeping new appropriation requests below estimated revenues, we\ncontinue to reduce the tremendous accumulation of unfinanced obligations\nincurred by the Government under past appropriations.Fourth, until those claims on our Government's revenues are further\nreduced, the growth in the public debt cannot be entirely stopped. Because\nof this--because the government's bills have to be paid every month, while\nthe tax money to pay them comes in with great unevenness within the fiscal\nyear--and because of the need for flexibility to manage this enormous debt,\nI find it necessary to renew my request for an increase in the statutory\ndebt limit.TAXESThe new budget provides for a lower level of taxation than has prevailed in\npreceding years. Six days ago individual income taxes were reduced and the\nexcess profits tax expired. These tax reductions are justified only because\nof the substantial reductions we already have made and are making in\ngovernmental expenditures. As additional reductions in expenditures are\nbrought gradually but surely into sight, further reductions in taxes can\nand will be made. When budget savings and sound governmental financing are\nassured, tax burdens should be reduced so that taxpayers may spend their\nown money in their own way.While we are moving toward lower levels of taxation we must thoroughly\nrevise our whole tax system. The groundwork for this revision has already\nbeen laid by the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of\nRepresentatives, in close consultation with the Department of the Treasury.\nWe should now remove the more glaring tax inequities, particularly on small\ntaxpayers; reduce restraints on the growth of small business; and make\nother changes that will encourage initiative, enterprise and production.\nTwenty-five recommendations toward these ends will be contained in my\nbudget message.Without attempting to summarize these manifold reforms, I can here\nillustrate their tendency. For example, we propose more liberal tax\ntreatment for dependent children who work, for widows or widowers with\ndependent children, and for medical expenses. For the business that wants\nto expand or modernize its plant, we propose liberalized tax treatment of\ndepreciation, research and development expenses, and retained earnings.Because of the present need for revenue the corporation income tax should\nbe kept at the current rate of 52% for another year, and the excise taxes\nscheduled to be reduced on April first, including those on liquor, tobacco,\ngasoline and automobiles, should be continued at present rates.Immediate extension of the Renegotiation Act of 1951 is also needed to\neliminate excessive profits and to prevent waste of public funds in the\npurchase of defense materials.AGRICULTUREThe well being of our 160 million people demands a stable and prosperous\nagriculture. Conversely, every farmer knows he cannot prosper unless all\nAmerica prospers. As we seek to promote increases in our standard of\nliving, we must be sure that the farmer fairly shares in that increase.\nTherefore, a farm program promoting stability and prosperity in all\nelements of our agriculture is urgently needed.Agricultural laws now in effect successfully accomplished their wartime\npurpose of encouraging maximum production of many crops. Today, production\nof these crops at such levels far exceeds present demand. Yet the laws\nencouraging such production are still in effect. The storage facilities of\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation bulge with surplus stocks of dairy\nproducts, wheat, cotton, corn, and certain vegetable oils; and the\nCorporation's presently authorized borrowing authority--$6,750,000,000--is\nnearly exhausted. Some products, priced out of domestic markets, and\nothers, priced out of world markets, have piled up in government hands. In\na world in which millions of people are hungry, destruction of food would,\nof course, be unconscionable. Yet surplus stocks continue to threaten the\nmarket and in spite of the acreage controls authorized by present law,\nsurpluses will continue to accumulate.We confront two alternatives. The first is to impose still greater acreage\nreductions for some crops and apply rigid Federal controls over the use of\nthe diverted acres. This will regiment the production of every basic\nagricultural crop. It will place every producer of those crops under the\ndomination and control of the Federal government in Washington. This\nalternative is contrary to the fundamental interests, not only of the\nfarmer, but of the Nation as a whole. Nor is it a real solution to the\nproblem facing us.The second alternative is to permit the market price for these agricultural\nproducts gradually to have a greater influence on the planning of\nproduction by farmers, while continuing the assistance of the government.\nThis is the sound approach. To make it effective, surpluses existing when\nthe new program begins must be insulated from the normal channels of trade\nfor special uses. These uses would include school lunch programs, disaster\nrelief, emergency assistance to foreign friends, and of particular\nimportance the stockpiling of reserves for a national emergency.Building on the agricultural laws of 1948 and 1949, we should establish a\nprice support program with enough flexibility to attract the production of\nneeded supplies of essential commodities and to stimulate the consumption\nof those commodities that are flooding American markets. Transition to\nmodernized parity must be accomplished gradually. In no case should there\nbe an abrupt downward change in the dollar level or in the percentage level\nof price supports.Next Monday I shall transmit to the Congress my detailed recommendations\nembodying this approach. They have been developed through the cooperation\nof innumerable individuals vitally interested in agriculture. My special\nmessage on Monday will briefly describe the consultative and advisory\nprocesses to which this whole program has been subjected during the past\nten months.I have chosen this farm program because it will build markets, protect the\nconsumers' food supply, and move food into consumption instead of into\nstorage. It is a program that will remove the threat to the farmer of these\noverhanging surpluses, a program, also, that will stimulate production when\na commodity is scarce and encourage consumption when nature is bountiful.\nMoreover, it will promote the individual freedom, responsibility, and\ninitiative which distinguish American agriculture. And, by helping our\nagriculture achieve full parity in the market, it promises our farmers a\nhigher and steadier financial return over the years than any alternative\nplan.CONSERVATIONPart of our Nation's precious heritage is its natural resources. It is the\ncommon responsibility of Federal, state, and local governments to improve\nand develop them, always working in the closest harmony and partnership.All Federal conservation and resource development projects are being\nreappraised. Sound projects now under way will be continued. New projects\nin which the Federal Government has a part must be economically sound, with\nlocal sharing of cost wherever appropriate and feasible. In the next fiscal\nyear work will be started on twenty-three projects that meet these\nstandards. The Federal Government will continue to construct and operate\neconomically sound flood control, power, irrigation and water supply\nprojects wherever these projects are beyond the capacity of local\ninitiative, public or private, and consistent with the needs of the whole\nNation.Our conservation program will also take into account the important role\nplayed by farmers in protecting our soil resources. I recommend enactment\nof legislation to strengthen agricultural conservation and upstream flood\nprevention work, and to achieve a better balance with major flood control\nstructures in the down-stream areas.Recommendations will be made from time to time for the adoption of:A uniform and consistent water resources policy;A revised public lands policy; andA sound program for safeguarding the domestic production of critical and\nstrategic metals and minerals.In addition we shall continue to protect and improve our national forests,\nparks, monuments and other natural and historic sites, as well as our\nfishery and wildlife resources. I hope that pending legislation to improve\nthe conservation and management of publicly-owned grazing lands in national\nforests will soon be approved by the Congress.NATIONAL HIGHWAYSTo protect the vital interest of every citizen in a safe and adequate\nhighway system, the Federal Government is continuing its central role in\nthe Federal Aid Highway Program. So that maximum progress can be made to\novercome present inadequacies in the Interstate Highway System, we must\ncontinue the Federal gasoline tax at two cents per gallon. This will\nrequire cancellation of the 1/2 cent decrease which otherwise will become\neffective April 1st, and will maintain revenues so that an expanded highway\nprogram can be undertaken.When the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations completes its study of\nthe present system of financing highway construction, I shall promptly\nsubmit it for consideration by the Congress and the governors of the\nstates.POST OFFICEIt is apparent that the substantial savings already made, and to be made,\nby the Post Office Department cannot eliminate the postal deficit. I\nrecommend, therefore, that the Congress approve the bill now pending in the\nHouse of Representatives providing for the adjustment of certain postal\nrates. To handle the long term aspects of this, I also recommend that the\nCongress create a permanent commission to establish fair and reasonable\npostal rates from time to time in the future.III. HUMAN PROBLEMSAlong with the protection of freedom and maintenance of a strong and\ngrowing economy, this Administration recognizes a third great purpose of\ngovernment: concern for the human problems of our citizens. In a modern\nindustrial society, banishment of destitution and cushioning the shock of\npersonal disaster on the individual are proper concerns of all levels of\ngovernment, including the federal government. This is especially true where\nremedy and prevention alike are beyond the individual's capacity.LABOR AND WELFAREOf the many problems in this area, those I shall first discuss are of\nparticular concern to the members of our great labor force, who with their\nheads, hearts and hands produce so much of the wealth of our country.Protection against the hazards of temporary unemployment should be extended\nto some 6 1/2 millions of workers, including civilian Federal workers, who\nnow lack this safeguard. Moreover, the Secretary of Labor is making\navailable to the states studies and recommendations in the fields of weekly\nbenefits, periods of protection and extension of coverage. The Economic\nReport will consider the related matter of minimum wages and their coverage.The Labor Management Relations Act of 3947 is basically a sound law.\nHowever, six years of experience have revealed that in some respects it can\nbe improved. On January 11, I shall forward to the Congress suggestions for\nchanges designed to reinforce the basic objectives of the Act.Our basic social security program, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance\nsystem, to which individuals contribute during their productive years and\nreceive benefits based on previous earnings, is designed to shield them\nfrom destitution. Last year I recommended extension of the social insurance\nsystem to include more than 10,000,000 additional persons. I ask that this\nextension soon be accomplished. This and other major improvements in the\ninsurance system will bring substantial benefit increases and broaden the\nmembership of the insurance system, thus diminishing the need for Federal\ngrants-in-aid for such purposes. A new formula will therefore be proposed,\npermitting progressive reduction in such grants as the need for them\ndeclines.Federal grant-in-aid welfare programs, now based on widely varying\nformulas, should be simplified. Concrete proposals on fourteen of them will\nbe suggested to the appropriate Committees.The program for rehabilitation of the disabled especially needs\nstrengthening. Through special vocational training, this program presently\nreturns each year some 60,000 handicapped individuals to productive work.\nFar more disabled people can be saved each year from idleness and\ndependence if this program is gradually increased. My more detailed\nrecommendations on this and the other social insurance problems I have\nmentioned will be sent to the Congress on January 14th.HEALTHI am flatly opposed to the socialization of medicine. The great need for\nhospital and medical services can best be met by the initiative of private\nplans. But it is unfortunately a fact that medical costs are rising and\nalready impose severe hardships on many families. The Federal Government\ncan do many helpful things and still carefully avoid the socialization of\nmedicine.The Federal Government should encourage medical research in its battle with\nsuch mortal diseases as cancer and heart ailments, and should continue to\nhelp the states in their health and rehabilitation programs. The present\nHospital Survey and Construction Act should be broadened in order to assist\nin the development of adequate facilities for the chronically ill, and to\nencourage the construction of diagnostic centers, rehabilitation\nfacilities, and nursing homes. The war on disease also needs a better\nworking relationship between Government and private initiative. Private and\nnon-profit hospital and medical insurance plans are already in the field,\nsoundly based on the experience and initiative of the people in their\nvarious communities.A limited Government reinsurance service would permit the private and\nnon-profit insurance companies to offer broader protection to more of the\nmany families which want and should have it. On January 18 I shall forward\nto the Congress a special message presenting this Administration's health\nprogram in its detail.EDUCATIONYouth--our greatest resource--is being seriously neglected in a vital\nrespect. The nation as a whole is not preparing teachers or building\nschools fast enough to keep up with the increase in our population.The preparation of teachers as, indeed, the control and direction of public\neducation policy, is a state and local responsibility. However, the Federal\nGovernment should stand ready to assist states which demonstrably cannot\nprovide sufficient school buildings. In order to appraise the needs, I hope\nthat this year a conference on education will be held in each state,\nculminating in a national conference. From these conferences on education,\nevery level of government--from the Federal Government to each local school\nboard--should gain the information with which to attack this serious\nproblem.HOUSINGThe details of a program to enlarge and improve the opportunities for our\npeople to acquire good homes will be presented to the Congress by special\nmessage on January 25.This program will include:Modernization of the home mortgage insurance program of the Federal\nGovernment;Redirection of the present system of loans and grants-in-aid to cities for\nslum clearance and redevelopment;Extension of the advantages of insured lending to private credit engaged in\nthis task of rehabilitating obsolete neighborhoods;Insurance of long-term, mortgage loans, with small down payment for\nlow-income families; and, until alternative programs prove more effective,Continuation of the public housing program adopted in the Housing Act of\n1949.If the individual, the community, the State and federal governments will\nalike apply themselves, every American family can have a decent home.VETERANS ADMINISTRATIONThe internal reorganization of the Veterans Administration is proceeding\nwith my full approval. When completed, it will afford a single agency whose\nservices, including medical facilities, will be better adapted to the needs\nof those 20,000,000 veterans to whom this Nation owes so much.SUFFRAGEMy few remaining recommendations all relate to a basic right of our\ncitizens--that of being represented in the decisions of the government.I hope that the States will cooperate with the Congress in adopting uniform\nstandards in their voting laws that will make it possible for our citizens\nin the armed forces overseas to vote.In the District of Columbia the time is long overdue for granting national\nsuffrage to its citizens and also applying the principle of local\nself-government to the Nation's Capital. I urge the Congress to move\npromptly in this direction and also to revise District revenue measures to\nprovide needed public works improvements.The people of Hawaii are ready for statehood. I renew my request for this\nlegislation in order that Hawaii may elect its State officials and its\nrepresentatives in Washington along with the rest of the country this\nfall.For years our citizens between the ages of 18 and 21 have, in time of\nperil, been summoned to fight for America. They should participate in the\npolitical process that produces this fateful summons. I urge Congress to\npropose to the States a constitutional amendment permitting citizens to\nvote when they reach the age of 18.CONCLUSIONI want to add one final word about the general purport of these many\nrecommendations.Our government's powers are wisely limited by the Constitution; but quite\napart from those limitations, there are things which no government can do\nor should try to do.A government can strive, as ours is striving, to maintain an economic\nsystem whose doors are open to enterprise and ambition--those personal\nqualities on which economic growth largely depends. But enterprise and\nambition are qualities which no government can supply. Fortunately no\nAmerican government need concern itself on this score; our people have\nthese qualities in good measure.A government can sincerely strive for peace, as ours is striving, and ask\nits people to make sacrifices for the sake of peace. But no government can\nplace peace in the hearts of foreign rulers. It is our duty then to\nourselves and to freedom itself to remain strong in all those\nways--spiritual, economic, military--that will give us maximum safety\nagainst the possibility of aggressive action by others.No government can inoculate its people against the fatal materialism that\nplagues our age. Happily, our people, though blessed with more material\ngoods than any people in history, have always reserved their first\nallegiance to the kingdom of the spirit, which is the true source of that\nfreedom we value above all material things.But a government can try, as ours tries, to sense the deepest aspirations\nof the people, and to express them in political action at home and abroad.\nSo long as action and aspiration humbly and earnestly seek favor in the\nsight of the Almighty, there is no end to America's forward road; there is\nno obstacle on it she will not surmount in her march toward a lasting peace\nin a free and prosperous world.",
