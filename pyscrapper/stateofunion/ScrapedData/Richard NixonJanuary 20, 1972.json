    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:Twenty-five years ago I sat here as a freshman Congressman--along with\nSpeaker Albert--and listened for the first time to the President address\nthe State of the Union.I shall never forget that moment. The Senate, the diplomatic corps, the\nSupreme Court, the Cabinet entered the Chamber, and then the President of\nthe United States. As all of you are aware, I had some differences with\nPresident Truman. He had some with me. But I remember that on that day--the\nday he addressed that joint session of the newly elected Republican 80th\nCongress, he spoke not as a partisan, but as President of all the\npeople--calling upon the Congress to put aside partisan considerations in\nthe national interest.The Greek-Turkish aid program, the Marshall Plan, the great foreign policy\ninitiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war for over\n25 years were approved by the 80th Congress, by a bipartisan majority of\nwhich I was proud to be a part.Nineteen hundred seventy-two is now before us. It holds precious time in\nwhich to accomplish good for the Nation. We must not waste it. I know the\npolitical pressures in this session of the Congress will be great. There\nare more candidates for the Presidency in this Chamber today than there\nprobably have been at any one time in the whole history of the Republic.\nAnd there is an honest difference of opinion, not only between the parties,\nbut within each party, on some foreign policy issues and on some domestic\npolicy issues.However, there are great national problems that are so vital that they\ntranscend partisanship. So let us have our debates. Let us have our honest\ndifferences. But let us join in keeping the national interest first. Let us\njoin in making sure that legislation the Nation needs does not become\nhostage to the political interests of any party or any person.There is ample precedent, in this election year, for me to present you with\na huge list of new proposals, knowing full well that there would not be any\npossibility of your passing them if you worked night and day.I shall not do that.I have presented to the leaders of the Congress today a message of 15,000\nwords discussing in some detail where the Nation stands and setting forth\nspecific legislative items on which I have asked the Congress to act. Much\nof this is legislation which I proposed in 1969, in 1970, and also in the\nfirst session of this 92d Congress and on which I feel it is essential that\naction be completed this year.I am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope of\npassage. I am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacity\nof this Congress to enact, within the capacity of the budget to finance,\nand which I believe should be above partisanship--programs which deal with\nurgent priorities for the Nation, which should and must be the subject of\nbipartisan action by this Congress in the interests of the country in\n1972.When I took the oath of office on the steps of this building just 3 years\nago today, the Nation was ending one of the most tortured decades in its\nhistory.The 1960's were a time of great progress in many areas. But as we all know,\nthey were also times of great agony--the agonies of war, of inflation, of\nrapidly rising crime, of deteriorating titles, of hopes raised and\ndisappointed, and of anger and frustration that led finally to violence and\nto the worst civil disorder in a century.I recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame. The Nation was\nso torn in those final years of the sixties that many in both parties\nquestioned whether America could be governed at all.The Nation has made significant progress in these first years of the\nseventies:Our cities are no longer engulfed by civil disorders.Our colleges and universities have again become places of learning instead\nof battlegrounds.A beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment.The rate of increase in crime has been slowed--and here in the District of\nColumbia, the one city where the Federal Government has direct\njurisdiction, serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent from\nthe year before.Most important, because of the beginnings that have been made, we can say\ntoday that this year 1972 can be the year in which America may make the\ngreatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at peace\nwith all the nations of the world.As our involvement in the war in Vietnam comes to an end, we must now go on\nto build a generation of peace.To achieve that goal, we must first face realistically the need to maintain\nour defense.In the past 3 years, we have reduced the burden of arms. For the first time\nin 20 years, spending on defense has been brought below spending on human\nresources.As we look to the future, we find encouraging progress in our negotiations\nwith the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms. And looking further\ninto the future, we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual\nreduction of arms. But until there is such a mutual agreement, we must\nmaintain the strength necessary to deter war.And that is why, because of rising research and development costs, because\nof increases in military and civilian pay, because of the need to proceed\nwith new weapons systems, my budget for the coming fiscal year will provide\nfor an increase in defense spending.Strong military defenses are not the enemy of peace; they are the guardians\nof peace.There could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which would\ntempt others by weakening America, and thereby endanger the peace of the\nworld.In our foreign policy, we have entered a new era. The world has changed\ngreatly in the 11 years since President John Kennedy said in his Inaugural\nAddress, \"... we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,\nsupport any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success\nof liberty.\"Our policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the new\nrealities of the new world we live in. We make today only those commitments\nwe are able and prepared to meet.Our commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable. But others must\nbear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world.And so this, then, is our policy:--We will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the\nsecurity of the United States or of our allies.--We will help other nations develop the capability of defending\nthemselves.--We will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments.--We will act to defend our interests, whenever and wherever they are\nthreatened anyplace in the world.--But where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved, our\nrole will be limited.--We will not intervene militarily.--But we will use our influence to prevent war.--If war comes, we will use our influence to stop it.--Once it is over, we will do our share in helping to bind up the wounds of\nthose who have participated in it.As you know, I will soon be visiting the People's Republic of China and the\nSoviet Union. I go there with no illusions. We have great differences with\nboth powers. We shall continue to have great differences. But peace depends\non the ability of great powers to live together on the same planet despite\ntheir differences.We would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if we\nfailed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we\nwill be able to talk about those differences, rather than to fight about\nthem, in the future.As we look back over this century, let us, in the highest spirit of\nbipartisanship, recognize that we can be proud of our Nation's record in\nforeign affairs.America has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom,\npreserving peace, alleviating human suffering around the globe, than any\nnation has ever done in the history of man.We have fought four wars in this century, but our power has never been used\nto break the peace, only to keep it; never been used to destroy freedom,\nonly to defend it. We now have within our reach the goal of insuring that\nthe next generation can be the first generation in this century to be\nspared the scourges of war.Turning to our problems at home, we are making progress toward our goal of\na new prosperity without war.Industrial production, consumer spending, retail sales, personal income all\nhave been rising. Total employment, real income are the highest in history.\nNew home building starts this past year reached the highest level ever.\nBusiness and consumer confidence have both been rising. Interest rates are\ndown. The rate of inflation is down. We can look with confidence to 1972 as\nthe year when the back of inflation will be broken.Now, this a good record, but it is not good enough--not when we still have\nan unemployment rate of 6 percent.It is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetime\nyears of the sixties, or that if the more than 2 million men released from\nthe Armed Forces and defense-related industries were still in their wartime\njobs, unemployment would be far lower.Our goal in this country is full employment in peacetime. We intend to meet\nthat goal, and we can.The Congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our job-creating tax\nprogram last month.The historic monetary agreements, agreements that we have reached with the\nmajor European nations, Canada, and Japan, will help meet it by providing\nnew markets for American products, new jobs for American workers.Our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being\ninflationary--a job-producing budget that will help take up the gap as the\neconomy expands to full employment.Our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalize\nrural America, by giving to America's farmers their fair share of America's\nincreasing productivity.We also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set\nof major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of America's great\ncapacity for technological advance, and to direct it toward improving the\nquality of life for every American.In reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles American technology is\ncapable of achieving. Now the time has come to move more deliberately\ntoward making full use of that technology here on earth, of harnessing the\nwonders of science to the service of man.I shall soon send to the Congress a special message proposing a new program\nof Federal partnership in technological research and development--with\nFederal incentives to increase private research, federally supported\nresearch on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways that\nwill range from improving mass transit to developing new systems of\nemergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually.Historically, our superior technology and high productivity have made it\npossible for American workers to be the highest paid in the world by far,\nand yet for our goods still to compete in world markets.Now we face a new situation. As other nations move rapidly forward in\ntechnology, the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall around\nAmerica, but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technology\nstill further and by increasing productivity in American industry.Our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for American\ngoods to compete fairly in the world's markets--but they still must\ncompete. The new technology program will put to use the skills of many\nhighly trained Americans, skills that might otherwise be wasted. It will\nalso meet the growing technological challenge from abroad, and it will thus\nhelp to create new industries, as well as creating more jobs for America's\nworkers in producing for the world's markets.This second session of the 92d Congress already has before it more than 90\nmajor Administration proposals which still await action.I have discussed these in the extensive written message that I have\npresented to the Congress today.They include, among others, our programs to improve life for the aging; to\ncombat crime and drug abuse; to improve health services and to ensure that\nno one will be denied needed health care because of inability to pay; to\nprotect workers' pension rights; to promote equal opportunity for members\nof minorities, and others who have been left behind; to expand consumer\nprotection; to improve the environment; to revitalize rural America; to\nhelp the cities; to launch new initiatives in education; to improve\ntransportation, and to put an end to costly labor tie-ups in\ntransportation.The west coast dock strike is a case in point. This Nation cannot and will\nnot tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie-up in the future.The messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our\nstructure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead.They include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare\nsystem--substitution of a new system that provides work requirements and\nwork incentives for those who can help themselves, income support for those\nwho cannot help themselves, and fairness to the working poor.They include a $17 billion program of Federal revenue sharing with the\nStates and localities as an investment in their renewal, an investment also\nof faith in the American people.They also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of the\nFederal Government so that it will be more efficient, more responsive, and\nable to meet the challenges of the decades ahead.One year ago, standing in this place, I laid before the opening session of\nthis Congress six great goals. One of these was welfare reform. That\nproposal has been before the Congress now for nearly 2 1/2 years.My proposals on revenue sharing, government reorganization, health care,\nand the environment have now been before the Congress for nearly a year.\nMany of the other major proposals that I have referred to have been here\nthat long or longer.Now, 1971, we can say, was a year of consideration of these measures. Now\nlet us join in making 1972 a year of action on them, action by the\nCongress, for the Nation and for the people of America.Now, in addition, there is one pressing need which I have not previously\ncovered, but which must be placed on the national agenda.We long have looked in this Nation to the local property tax as the main\nsource of financing for public primary and secondary education.As a result, soaring school costs, soaring property tax rates now threaten\nboth our communities and our schools. They threaten communities because\nproperty taxes, which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1960 to '70,\nhave become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxes,\nhitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired; and they threaten\nschools, as hard-pressed voters understandably reject new bond issues at\nthe polls.The problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court\ndecisions, which have held that the conventional method of financing\nschools through local property taxes is discriminatory and\nunconstitutional.Nearly 2 years ago, I named a special Presidential commission to study the\nproblems of school finance, and I also directed the Federal departments to\nlook into the same problems. We are developing comprehensive proposals to\nmeet these problems.This issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems: support\nof the schools and the basic relationships of Federal, State, and local\ngovernments in any tax reforms.Under the leadership of the Secretary of the Treasury, we are carefully\nreviewing all of the tax aspects, and I have this week enlisted the\nAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in addressing the\nintergovernmental relations aspects.I have asked this bipartisan Commission to review our proposals for Federal\naction to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and property\ntaxes. Later in the year, when both Commissions have completed their\nstudies, I shall make my final recommendations for relieving the burden of\nproperty taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing for our\nchildren's education.These recommendations will be revolutionary. But all these recommendations,\nhowever, will be rooted in one fundamental principle with which there can\nbe no compromise: Local school boards must have control over local\nschools.As we look ahead over the coming decades, vast new growth and change are\nnot only certainties, they will be the dominant reality of this world, and\nparticularly of our life in America.Surveying the certainty of rapid change, we can be like a fallen rider\ncaught in the stirrups--or we can sit high in the saddle, the masters of\nchange, directing it on a course we choose.The secret of mastering change in today's world is to reach back to old and\nproven principles, and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to\nthe new realities of a new age.That is what we have done in the proposals that I have laid before the\nCongress. They are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as human\nnature, as robust as the American experience; and they are responsive to\nnew conditions. Thus they represent a spirit of change that is truly\nrenewal.As we look back at those old principles, we find them as timely as they are\ntimeless.We believe in independence, and self-reliance, and the creative value of\nthe competitive spirit.We believe in full and equal opportunity for all Americans and in the\nprotection of individual rights and liberties.We believe in the family as the keystone of the community, and in the\ncommunity as the keystone of the Nation.We believe in compassion toward those in need.We believe in a system of law, justice, and order as the basis of a\ngenuinely free society.We believe that a person should get what he works for--and that those who\ncan, should work for what they get.We believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in their\nown lives, in their own communities--and we believe in their right to make\nthose decisions.In applying these principles, we have done so with the full understanding\nthat what we seek in the seventies, what our quest is, is not merely for\nmore, but for better for a better quality of life for all Americans.Thus, for example, we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning up\nour air and water, making our surroundings more attractive. We are\nproviding broader support for the arts, helping stimulate a deeper\nappreciation of what they can contribute to the Nation's activities and to\nour individual lives.But nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way we\ntreat one another, than our capacity to live respectfully together as a\nunified society, with a full, generous regard for the rights of others and\nalso for the feelings of others.As we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years, as we learn\nonce again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another, we\nare regaining that capacity.As is customary here, on this occasion, I have been talking about programs.\nPrograms are important. But even more important than programs is what we\nare as a Nation--what we mean as a Nation, to ourselves and to the world.In New York Harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the world--the\nStatue of Liberty, the gift in 1886 of the people of France to the people\nof the United States. This statue is more than a landmark; it is a\nsymbol--a symbol of what America has meant to the world.It reminds us that what America has meant is not its wealth, and not its\npower, but its spirit and purpose--a land that enshrines liberty and\nopportunity, and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in search\nof a better and a fuller and, above all, a freer life.The world's hopes poured into America, along with its people. And those\nhopes, those dreams, that have been brought here from every corner of the\nworld, have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world.Four years from now, America will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its\nfounding as a Nation. There are those who say that the old Spirit of '76 is\ndead--that we no longer have the strength of character, the idealism, the\nfaith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents.Those who say this do not know America.We have been undergoing self-doubts and self-criticism. But these are only\nthe other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of want in the\nmidst of plenty, of our impatience with the slowness with which age-old\nills are being overcome.If we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society, or complacent\nabout our institutions, or blind to the lingering inequities--then we would\nhave lost our way.But the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals, deep\ndown, are still strong. Indeed, they remind us that what is really best\nabout America is its compassion. They remind us that in the final analysis,\nAmerica is great not because it is strong, not because it is rich, but\nbecause this is a good country.Let us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we are\nevil because we are not yet perfect, that we are corrupt because we are not\nyet pure, that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have gone into the\nbuilding of America were for naught because the building is not yet done.Let us see that the path we are traveling is wide, with room in it for all\nof us, and that its direction is toward a better Nation and a more peaceful\nworld.Never has it mattered more that we go forward together.Look at this Chamber. The leadership of America is here today--the Supreme\nCourt, the Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives.Together, we hold the future of the Nation, and the conscience of the\nNation in our hands.Because this year is an election year, it will be a time of great\npressure.If we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic\nchallenges that we face, we will have failed the trust of millions of\nAmericans and shaken the confidence they have a right to place in us, in\ntheir Government.Never has a Congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of a\nprofound and constructive reform for the Nation than this Congress.If we succeed in these tasks, there will be credit enough for all--not only\nfor doing what is right, but doing it in the right way, by rising above\npartisan interest to serve the national interest.And if we fail, more than any one of us, America will be the loser.That is why my call upon the Congress today is for a high statesmanship, so\nthat in the years to come Americans will look back and say because it\nwithstood the intense pressures of a political year, and achieved such\ngreat good for the American people and for the future of this Nation, this\nwas truly a great Congress.",
