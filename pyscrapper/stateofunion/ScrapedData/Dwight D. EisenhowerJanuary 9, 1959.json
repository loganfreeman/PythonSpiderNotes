    "speech": "Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 86th Congress, my fellow\ncitizens:This is the moment when Congress and the Executive annually begin their\ncooperative work to build a better America.One basic purpose unites us: To promote strength and security, side by side\nwith liberty and opportunity.As we meet today, in the 170th year of the Republic, our Nation must\ncontinue to provide--as all other free governments have had to do\nthroughout time--a satisfactory answer to a question as old as history. It\nis: Can Government based upon liberty and the God-given rights of man,\npermanently endure when ceaselessly challenged by a dictatorship, hostile\nto our mode of life, and controlling an economic and military power of\ngreat and growing strength?For us the answer has always been found, and is still found in the\ndevotion, the vision, the courage and the fortitude of our people.Moreover, this challenge we face, not as a single powerful nation, but as\none that has in recent decades reached a position of recognized leadership\nin the Free World.We have arrived at this position of leadership in an era of remarkable\nproductivity and growth. It is also a time when man's power of mass\ndestruction has reached fearful proportions.Possession of such capabilities helps create world suspicion and tension.\nWe, on our part, know that we seek only a just peace for all, with\naggressive designs against no one. Yet we realize that there is uneasiness\nin the world because of a belief on the part of peoples that through\narrogance, miscalculation or fear of attack, catastrophic war could be\nlaunched. Keeping the peace in today's world more than ever calls for the\nutmost in the nation's resolution, wisdom, steadiness and unremitting\neffort.We cannot build peace through desire alone. Moreover, we have learned the\nbitter lesson that international agreements, historically considered by us\nas sacred, are regarded in Communist doctrine and in practice to be mere\nscraps of paper. The most recent proof of their disdain of international\nobligations, solemnly undertaken, is their announced intention to abandon\ntheir responsibilities respecting Berlin.As a consequence, we can have no confidence in any treaty to which\nCommunists are a party except where such a treaty provides within itself\nfor self-enforcing mechanisms. Indeed, the demonstrated disregard of the\nCommunists of their own pledges is one of the greatest obstacles to success\nin substituting the Rule of Law for rule by force.Yet step by step we must strengthen the institutions of peace--a peace that\nrests upon justice--a peace that depends upon a deep knowledge and dear\nunderstanding by all peoples of the cause and consequences of possible\nfailure in this great purpose.To achieve this peace we seek to prevent war at any place and in any\ndimension. If, despite our best efforts, a local dispute should flare into\narmed hostilities, the next problem would be to keep the conflict from\nspreading, and so compromising freedom. In support of these objectives we\nmaintain forces of great power and flexibility.Our formidable air striking forces are a powerful deterrent to general war.\nLarge and growing portions of these units can depart from their bases in a\nmatter of minutes.Similar forces are included in our naval fleets.Ground and other tactical formations can move with swiftness and precision,\nwhen requested by friendly and responsible governments, to help curb\nthreatened aggression. The stabilizing influence of this capacity has been\ndramatically demonstrated more than once over the past year.Our military and related scientific progress has been highly gratifying.Great strides have been made in the development of ballistic missiles.\nIntermediate range missiles are now being deployed in operational units.\nThe Arias intercontinental ballistic missile program has been marked by\nrapid development as evidenced by recent successful tests. Missile training\nunits have been established and launching sites are far along in\nconstruction.New aircraft that fly at twice the speed of sound are entering our\nsquadrons.We have successfully placed five satellites in orbit, which have gathered\ninformation of scientific importance never before available. Our latest\nsatellite illustrates our steady advance in rocketry and foreshadows new\ndevelopments in world-wide communications.Warning systems constantly improve.Our atomic submarines have shattered endurance records and made historic\nvoyages under the North Polar Sea.A major segment of our national scientific and engineering community is\nworking intensively to achieve new and greater developments. Advance in\nmilitary technology requires adequate financing but, of course, even more,\nit requires talent and time.All this is given only as a matter of history; as a record of our progress\nin space and ballistic missile fields in no more than four years of\nintensive effort. At the same time we clearly recognize that some of the\nrecent Soviet accomplishments in this particular technology are indeed\nbrilliant.Under the law enacted last year the Department of Defense is being\nreorganized to give the Secretary of Defense full authority over the\nmilitary establishment. Greater efficiency, more cohesive effort and\nspeedier reaction to emergencies are among the many advantages we are\nalready noting from these changes.These few highlights point up our steady military gains. We are rightfully\ngratified by the achievements they represent. But we must remember that\nthese imposing armaments are purchased at great cost.National Security programs account for nearly sixty percent of the entire\nFederal budget for this coming fiscal year.Modern weapons are exceedingly expensive.The overall cost of introducing ATLAS into our armed forces will average\n$35 million per missile on the firing line.This year we are investing an aggregate of close to $7 billion in missile\nprograms alone.Other billions go for research, development, test and evaluation of new\nweapons systems.Our latest atomic submarines will cost $50 millions each, while some\nspecial types will cost three times as much.We are now ordering fighter aircraft which are priced at fifty times as\nmuch as the fighters of World War II.We are buying certain bombers that cost their weight in gold.These sums are tremendous, even when compared with the marvelous resiliency\nand capacity of our economy.Such expenditures demand both balance and perspective in our planning for\ndefense. At every turn, we must weigh, judge and select. Needless\nduplication of weapons and forces must be avoided.We must guard against feverish building of vast armaments to meet glibly\npredicted moments of so-called \"maximum peril.\" The threat we face is not\nsporadic or dated: It is continuous. Hence we must not be swayed in our\ncalculations either by groundless fear or by complacency. We must avoid\nextremes, for vacillation between extremes is inefficient, costly, and\ndestructive of morale. In these days of unceasing technological advance, we\nmust plan our defense expenditures systematically and with care, fully\nrecognizing that obsolescence compels the never-ending replacement of older\nweapons with new ones.The defense budget for the coming year has been planned on the basis of\nthese principles and considerations. Over these many months I have\npersonally participated in its development.The aim is a sensible posture of defense. The secondary aim is increased\nefficiency and avoidance of waste. Both are achieved by this budgetary\nplan.Working by these guide lines I believe with all my heart that America can\nbe as sure of the strength and efficiency of her armed forces as she is of\ntheir loyalty. I am equally sure that the nation will thus avoid useless\nexpenditures which, in the name of security, might tend to undermine the\neconomy and, therefore, the nation's safety.Our own vast strength is only a part of that required for dependable\nsecurity. Because of this we have joined with nearly 50 other nations in\ncollective security arrangements. In these common undertakings each nation\nis expected to contribute what it can in sharing the heavy load. Each\nsupplies part of a strategic deployment to protect the forward boundaries\nof freedom.Constantly we seek new ways to make more effective our contribution to this\nsystem of collective security. Recently I have asked a Committee of eminent\nAmericans of both parties to re-appraise our military assistance programs\nand the relative emphasis which should be placed on military and economic\naid.I am hopeful that preliminary recommendations of this Committee will be\navailable in time to assist in shaping the Mutual Security program for the\ncoming fiscal year.Any survey of the free world's defense structure cannot fail to impart a\nfeeling of regret that so much of our effort and resources must be devoted\nto armaments. At Geneva and elsewhere we continue to seek technical and\nother agreements that may help to open up, with some promise, the issues of\ninternational disarmament. America will never give up the hope that\neventually all nations can, with mutual confidence, drastically reduce\nthese non-productive expenditures. II.The material foundation of our national safety is a strong and expanding\neconomy. This we have--and this we must maintain. Only with such an economy\ncan we be secure and simultaneously provide for the well-being of our\npeople.A year ago the nation was experiencing a decline in employment and output.\nToday that recession is fading into history, and this without gigantic,\nhastily-improvised public works projects or untimely tax reductions. A\nhealthy and vigorous recovery has been under way since last May. New homes\nare being built at the highest rate in several years. Retail sales are at\npeak levels. Personal income is at an all-time high.The marked forward thrust of our economy reaffirms our confidence in\ncompetitive enterprise. But--clearly--wisdom and prudence in both the\npublic and private sectors of the economy are always necessary.Our outlook is this: 1960 commitments for our armed forces, the Atomic\nEnergy Commission and Military Assistance exceed 47 billion dollars. In the\nforeseeable future they are not likely to be significantly lower. With an\nannual population increase of three million, other governmental costs are\nbound to mount.After we have provided wisely for our military strength, we must judge how\nto allocate our remaining government resources most effectively to promote\nour well-being and economic growth.Federal programs that will benefit all citizens are moving forward.Next year we will be spending increased amounts on health programs; on\nFederal assistance to science and education; on the development of the\nnation's water resources; on the renewal of urban areas; and on our vast\nsystem of Federal-aid highways.Each of these additional outlays is being made necessary by the surging\ngrowth of America.Let me illustrate. Responsive to this growth, Federal grants and long term\nloans to assist 14 major types of capital improvements in our cities will\ntotal over 2 billion dollars in 1960--double the expenditure of two years\nago. The major responsibility for development in these fields rests in the\nlocalities, even though the Federal Government will continue to do its\nproper part in meeting the genuine needs of a burgeoning population.But the progress of our economy can more than match the growth of our\nneeds. We need only to act wisely and confidently.Here, I hope you will permit me to digress long enough to express something\nthat is much on my mind.The basic question facing us today is more than mere survival--the military\ndefense of national life and territory. It is the preservation of a way of\nlife.We must meet the world challenge and at the same time permit no stagnation\nin America.Unless we progress, we regress.We can successfully sustain security and remain true to our heritage of\nfreedom if we clearly visualize the tasks ahead and set out to perform them\nwith resolution and fervor. We must first define these tasks and then\nunderstand what we must do to perform them.If progress is to be steady we must have long term guides extending far\nahead, certainly five, possibly even ten years. They must reflect the\nknowledge that before the end of five years we will have a population of\nover 190 million. They must be goals that stand high, and so inspire every\ncitizen to climb always toward mounting levels of moral, intellectual and\nmaterial strength. Every advance toward them must stir pride in individual\nand national achievements.To define these goals, I intend to mobilize help from every available\nsource.We need more than politically ordained national objectives to challenge the\nbest efforts of free men and women. A group of selfless and devoted\nindividuals, outside of government, could effectively participate in making\nthe necessary appraisal of the potentials of our future. The result would\nbe establishment of national goals that would not only spur us on to our\nfinest efforts, but would meet the stern test of practicality.The Committee I plan will comprise educators and representatives of labor,\nmanagement, finance, the professions and every other kind of useful\nactivity.Such a study would update and supplement, in the light of continuous\nchanges in our society and its economy, the monumental work of the\nCommittee on Recent Social Trends which was appointed in 1931 by President\nHoover. Its report has stood the test of time and has had a beneficial\ninfluence on national development. The new Committee would be concerned,\namong other things, with the acceleration of our economy's growth and the\nliving standards of our people, their health and education, their better\nassurance of life and liberty and their greater opportunities. It would\nalso be concerned with methods to meet such goals and what levels of\ngovernment--Local, State, or Federal--might or should be particularly\nconcerned.As one example, consider our schools, operated under the authority of local\ncommunities and states. In their capacity and in their quality they conform\nto no recognizable standards. In some places facilities are ample, in\nothers meager. Pay of teachers ranges between wide limits, from the\nadequate to the shameful. As would be expected, quality of teaching varies\njust as widely. But to our teachers we commit the most valuable possession\nof the nation and of the family--our children.We must have teachers of competence. To obtain and hold them we need\nstandards. We need a National Goal. Once established I am certain that\npublic opinion would compel steady progress toward its accomplishment.Such studies would be helpful, I believe, to government at all levels and\nto all individuals. The goals so established could help us see our current\nneeds in perspective. They will spur progress.We do not forget, of course, that our nation's progress and fiscal\nintegrity are interdependent and inseparable. We can afford everything we\nclearly need, but we cannot afford one cent of waste. We must examine every\nitem of governmental expense critically. To do otherwise would betray our\nnation's future. Thrift is one of the characteristics that has made this\nnation great. Why should we ignore it now?We must avoid any contribution to inflationary processes, which could\ndisrupt sound growth in our economy.Prices have displayed a welcome stability in recent months and, if we are\nwise and resolute, we will not tolerate inflation in the years to come. But\nhistory makes clear the risks inherent in any failure to deal firmly with\nthe .basic causes of inflation. Two of the most important of these causes\nare the wage-price spiral and continued deficit financing.Inflation would reduce job opportunities, price us out of world markets,\nshrink the value of savings and penalize the thrift so essential to finance\na growing economy.Inflation is not a Robin Hood, taking from the rich to give to the poor.\nRather, it deals most cruelly with those who can least protect themselves.\nIt strikes hardest those millions of our citizens whose incomes do not\nquickly rise with the cost of living. When prices soar, the pensioner and\nthe widow see their security undermined, the man of thrift sees his savings\nmelt away; the white collar worker, the minister, and the teacher see their\nstandards of living dragged down.Inflation can be prevented. But this demands statesmanship on the part of\nbusiness and labor leaders and of government at all levels.We must encourage the self-discipline, the restraint necessary to curb the\nwage-price spiral and we must meet current costs from current revenue.To minimize the danger of future soaring prices and to keep our economy\nsound and expanding, I shall present to the Congress certain proposals.First, I shall submit a balanced budget for the next year, a year expected\nto be the most prosperous in our history. It is a realistic budget with\nwholly attainable objectives.If we cannot live within our means during such a time of rising prosperity,\nthe hope for fiscal integrity will fade. If we persist in living beyond our\nmeans, we make it difficult for every family in our land to balance its own\nhousehold budget. But to live within our means would be a tangible\ndemonstration of the self-discipline needed to assure a stable dollar.The Constitution entrusts the Executive with many functions, but the\nCongress--and the Congress alone--has the power of the purse. Ultimately\nupon Congress rests responsibility for determining the scope and amount of\nFederal spending.By working together, the Congress and the Executive can keep a balance\nbetween income and outgo. If this is done there is real hope that we can\nlook forward to a time in the foreseeable future when needed tax reforms\ncan be accomplished.In this hope, I am requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare\nappropriate proposals for revising, at the proper time, our tax structure,\nto remove inequities and to enhance incentives for all Americans to work,\nto save, and to invest. Such recommendations will be made as soon as our\nfiscal condition permits. These prospects will be brightened if 1960\nexpenditures do not exceed the levels recommended.Second, I shall recommend to the Congress that the Chief Executive be given\nthe responsibility either to approve or to veto specific items in\nappropriations and authorization bills. This would save tax dollars.Third, to reduce Federal operations in an area where private enterprise can\ndo the job, I shall recommend legislation for greater flexibility in\nextending Federal credit, and in improving the procedures under which\nprivate credits are insured or guaranteed. Present practices have\nneedlessly added large sums to Federal expenditures.Fourth, action is required to make more effective use of the large Federal\nexpenditures for agriculture and to achieve greater fiscal control in this\narea.Outlays of the Department of Agriculture for the current fiscal year for\nthe support of farm prices on a very few farm products will exceed five\nbillion dollars. That is a sum equal to approximately two-fifths of the net\nincome of all farm operators in the entire United States.By the end of this fiscal year it is estimated that there will be in\nGovernment hands surplus farm products worth about nine billion dollars.\nAnd by July 1, 1959, Government expenditures for storage, interest, and\nhandling of its agricultural inventory will reach a rate of one billion\ndollars a year.This level of expenditure for farm products could be made willingly for a\ntemporary period if it were leading to a sound solution of the problem. But\nunfortunately this is not true. We need new legislation.In the past I have sent messages to the Congress requesting greater freedom\nfor our farmers to manage their own farms and greater freedom for markets\nto reflect the wishes of producers and consumers. Legislative changes that\nfollowed were appropriate in direction but did not go far enough.The situation calls for prompt and forthright action. Recommendation for\naction will be contained in a message to be transmitted to the Congress\nshortly.These fiscal and related actions will help create an environment of price\nstability for economic growth. However, certain additional measures are\nneeded.I shall ask Congress to amend the Employment Act of 1946 to make it clear\nthat Government intends to use all appropriate means to protect the buying\npower of the dollar.I am establishing a continuing Cabinet group on Price Stability for\nEconomic Growth to study governmental and private policies affecting costs,\nprices, and economic growth. It will strive also to build a better public\nunderstanding of the conditions necessary for maintaining growth and price\nstability.Studies are being undertaken to improve our information on prices, wages,\nand productivity.I believe all citizens in all walks of life will support this program of\naction to accelerate economic growth and promote price stability. III.I take up next certain aspects of our international situation and our\nprograms to strengthen it.America's security can be assured only within a world community strong,\nstable, independent nations, in which the concepts of freedom, justice and\nhuman dignity can flourish.There can be no such thing as Fortress America. If ever we were reduced to\nthe isolation implied by that term, we would occupy a prison, not a\nfortress. The question whether we can afford to help other nations that\nwant to defend their freedom but cannot fully do so from their own means,\nhas only one answer: we can and we must, we have been doing so since 1947.Our foreign policy has long been dedicated to building a permanent and just\npeace.During the past six years our free world security arrangements have been\nbolstered and the bonds of freedom have been more closely knit. Our friends\nin Western Europe are experiencing new internal vitality, and are\nincreasingly more able to resist external threats.Over the years the world has come to understand clearly that it is our firm\npolicy not to countenance aggression. In Lebanon, Taiwan, and Berlin--our\nstand has been dear, right, and expressive of the determined will of a\nunited people.Acting with other free nations we have undertaken the solemn obligation to\ndefend the people of free Berlin against any effort to destroy their\nfreedom. In the meantime we shall constantly seek meaningful agreements to\nsettle this and other problems, knowing full well that not only the\nintegrity of a single city, but the hope of all free peoples is at stake.We need, likewise, to continue helping to build the economic base so\nessential to the Free World's stability and strength.The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have both fully proven\ntheir worth as instruments of international financial cooperation. Their\nExecutive Directors have recommended an increase in each member country's\nsubscription. I am requesting the Congress for immediate approval of our\nshare of these increases.We are now negotiating with representatives of the twenty Latin American\nRepublics for the creation of an inter-American financial institution. Its\npurpose would be to join all the American Republics in a common institution\nwhich would promote and finance development in Latin America, and make more\neffective the use of capital from the World Bank, the Export-Import Bank,\nand private sources.Private enterprise continues to make major contributions to economic\ndevelopment in all parts of the world. But we have not yet marshalled the\nfull potential of American business for this task, particularly in\ncountries which have recently attained their independence. I shall present\nto this Congress a program designed to encourage greater participation by\nprivate enterprise in economic development abroad.Further, all of us know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do\nmuch more than help build sound economies. The spiritual, intellectual, and\nphysical strength of people throughout the world will in the last analysis\ndetermine their willingness and their ability to resist Communism.To give a single illustration of our many efforts in these fields: We have\nbeen a participant in the effort that has been made over the past few years\nagainst one of the great scourges of mankind--disease. Through the Mutual\nSecurity program public health officials are being trained by American\nuniversities to serve in less developed countries. We are engaged in\nintensive malaria eradication projects in many parts of the world.\nAmerica's major successes in our own country prove the feasibility of\nsuccess everywhere.By these and other means we shall continue and expand our campaign against\nthe afflictions that now bring needless suffering and death to so many of\nthe world's people. We wish to be part of a great shared effort toward the\ntriumph of health. IV.America is best described by one word, freedom.If we hope to strengthen freedom in the world we must be ever mindful of\nhow our own conduct reacts elsewhere. No nation has ever been so\nfloodlighted by world opinion as the United States is today. Everything we\ndo is carefully scrutinized by other peoples throughout the world. The bad\nis seen along with the good.Because we are human we err. But as free men we are also responsible for\ncorrecting the errors and imperfections of our ways.Last January I made comprehensive recommendations to the Congress for\nlegislation in the labor-management field. To my disappointment, Congress\nfailed to act. The McClellan Committee disclosures of corruption,\nracketeering, and abuse of trust and power in labor-management affairs have\naroused America and amazed other peoples. They emphasize the need for\nimproved local law enforcement and the enactment of effective Federal\nlegislation to protect the public interest and to insure the rights and\neconomic freedoms of millions of American workers. Halfhearted measures\nwill not do. I shall recommend prompt enactment of legislation designed:To safeguard workers' funds in union treasuries against misuse of any kind\nwhatsoever.To protect the rights and freedoms of individual union members, including\nthe basic right to free and secret elections of officers.To advance true and responsible collective bargaining.To protect the public and innocent third parties from unfair and coercive\npractices such as boycotting and blackmail picketing.The workers and the public must have these vital protections.In other areas of human rights--freedom from discrimination in voting, in\npublic education, in access to jobs, and in other respects--the world is\nlikewise watching our conduct.The image of America abroad is not improved when school children, through\nclosing of some of our schools and through no fault of their own, are\ndeprived of their opportunity for an education.The government of a free people has no purpose more noble than to work for\nthe maximum realization of equality of opportunity under law. This is not\nthe sole responsibility of any one branch of our government. The judicial\narm, which has the ultimate authority for interpreting the Constitution,\nhas held that certain state laws and practices discriminate upon racial\ngrounds and are unconstitutional. Whenever the supremacy of the\nConstitution of the United States is challenged I shall continue to take\nevery action necessary to uphold it.One of the fundamental concepts of our constitutional system is that it\nguarantees to every individual, regardless of race, religion, or national\norigin, the equal protection of the laws. Those of us who are privileged to\nhold public office have a solemn obligation to make meaningful this\ninspiring objective. We can fulfill that obligation by our leadership in\nteaching, persuading, demonstrating, and in enforcing the law.We are making noticeable progress in the field of civil rights--we are\nmoving forward toward achievement of equality of opportunity for all people\neverywhere in the United States. In the interest of the nation and of each\nof its citizens, that progress must continue.Legislative proposals of the Administration in this field will be submitted\nto the Congress early in the session. All of us should help to make clear\nthat the government is united in the common purpose of giving support to\nthe law and the decisions of the Courts.By moving steadily toward the goal of greater freedom under law, for our\nown people, we shall be the better prepared to work for the cause of\nfreedom under law throughout the world.All peoples are solely tired of the fear, destruction, and the waste of\nwar. As never before, the world knows the human and material costs of war\nand seeks to replace force with a genuine role of law among nations.It is my purpose to intensify efforts during the coming two years in\nseeking ways to supplement the procedures of the United Nations and other\nbodies with similar objectives, to the end that the rule of law may replace\nthe rule of force in the affairs of nations. Measures toward this end will\nbe proposed later, including a re-examination of our own relation to the\nInternational Court of Justice.Finally--let us remind ourselves that Marxist scripture is not new; it is\nnot the gospel of the future. Its basic objective is dictatorship, old as\nhistory. What is new is the shining prospect that man can build a world\nwhere all can live in dignity.We seek victory--not over any nation or people--but over the ancient\nenemies of us all; victory over ignorance, poverty, disease, and human\ndegradation wherever they may be found.We march in the noblest of causes--human freedom.If we make ourselves worthy of America's ideals, if we do not forget that\nour nation was founded on the premise that all men are creatures of God's\nmaking, the world will come to know that it is free men who carry forward\nthe true promise of human progress and dignity.",
