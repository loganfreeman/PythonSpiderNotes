    "speech": "Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again called into\noffice no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to my fellow citizens at\nlarge the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony\nof public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for\nall those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been\nhonored by my country, on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish\nfor that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have\ntorn me. But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated\naccording to its real motives, and that the people, and the authorities\nderived from them, would support exertions having nothing personal for\ntheir object, I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the\nExecutive power; and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of\nnations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general\nhappiness.As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United\nStates have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that\nour intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for\npeace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by\nbelligerent nations. It seemed, therefore, to be my duty to admonish our\ncitizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to\nany of the parties, and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal\nstate of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities\nbelonging to our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which\nwill be laid before you was issued.In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I resolved to adopt\ngeneral rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the\nprivileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system, which\nwill be communicated to you. Although I have not thought of myself at\nliberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of\ncommerce with France to be brought into our ports, I have not refused to\ncause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our\nterritory, or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within\nthe limits of the United States.It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve, or enforce this\nplan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the\nlegal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States to many\ncases which, though dependent on principles already recognized, demand some\nfurther provisions.Where individuals shall, within the United States, array themselves in\nhostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon military\nexpeditions or enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States, or\nusurp and exercise judicial authority within the United States, or where\nthe penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been\nindistinctly marked, or are inadequate--these offenses can not receive too\nearly and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies.Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered by the\njudiciary, who possess a long-established course of investigation,\neffectual process, and officers in the habit of executing it.In like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, under particular\ncircumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace,\nand even of a citizen of the United States, although seized under a false\ncolor of being hostile property, and have denied their power to liberate\ncertain captures within the protection of our territory, it would seem\nproper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the Executive\nis to be the resort in either of the two last-mentioned cases, it is hoped\nthat he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts\nwhen for his own information he shall request it.I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our\nduties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the\nnecessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of\nexacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United\nStates ought not to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to the order of\nhuman events, they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to\narms with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank\ndue to the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not\nabsolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid\ninsult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of\nthe most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known\nthat we are at all times ready for war. The documents which will be\npresented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores\nnow in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even to these\nsupplies can not with prudence be neglected, as it would leave nothing to\nthe uncertainty of procuring warlike apparatus in the moment of public\ndanger.Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the censure or\njealousy of the warmest friends of republican government. They are\nincapable of abuse in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess a\npride in being the depository of the force of the Republic, and may be\ntrained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the\nUnited States. But it is an inquiry which can not be too solemnly pursued,\nwhether the act \"more effectually to provide for the national defense by\nestablishing an uniform militia throughout the United States\" has organized\nthem so as to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the\nseveral States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme, and\nwhether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to\nafford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art\nwhich can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone.The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely\ninteresting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the\nknowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent\ncommunication.When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed that\nevery reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension\nwith the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the\ncommissioners evince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love\nof peace, and a liberality having no restriction but the essential\ninterests and dignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an\namicable negotiation having been frustrated, the troops have marched to act\noffensively. Although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of\nmilitary preparation, it is doubtful how far the advance of the season,\nbefore good faith justified active movements, may retard them during the\nremainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to\nthis important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the\nnumber of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia,\nor additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits.An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the\nCreeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with\nclothing, and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess\nof Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter, prosecutions have\nbeen instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers which\nwill be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in\nregard to both those tribes, and it is with Congress to pronounce what\nshall be done.After they shall have provided for the present emergency, it will merit\ntheir most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanent\nby creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice on\nthe violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian\nnations in behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their\nattachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion,\nwith constant and plentiful supplies, with a ready market for the\ncommodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment\nand receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless\nthey be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United\nStates to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the\nopinion of Congress, they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by\nany means yet in the hands of the Executive.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:The commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between the\nUnited States and individual States concluded their important function\nwithin the time limited by law, and the balances struck in their report,\nwhich will be laid before Congress, have been placed on the books of the\nTreasury.On the first day of June last an installment of 1,000,000 florins became\npayable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by\na prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an\ninterest of 5% for the term of ten years, and the expenses of this\noperation were a commission of 3%.The first installment of the loan of $2,000,000 from the Bank of the United\nStates has been paid, as was directed by law. For the second it is\nnecessary that provision be made.No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemption and\ndischarge of the public debt. On none can delay be more injurious or an\neconomy of time more valuable.The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal\nthe anticipations which were formed of it, but it is not expected to prove\ncommensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary\nprovisions will therefore, it is presumed, be requisite, and it is hoped\nthat these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of\nour citizens, who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of\nencountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a\nfuture accumulation of burthens.But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the\ntransportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the\nGovernment of the United States as the affections of the people, guided by\nan enlightened policy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more\nthan a faithful representation of public proceedings, diffused without\nrestraint throughout the United States.An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the\nensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made\nduring the recess will be presented to Congress.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:The several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to your\ndeliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common\ncountry. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task.\nWithout an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the Government may be\nhazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its\ndignity may be lost. But as the legislative proceedings of the United\nStates will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of temper or of\ncandor, so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my\nstrenuous and warmest cooperation.GO.
