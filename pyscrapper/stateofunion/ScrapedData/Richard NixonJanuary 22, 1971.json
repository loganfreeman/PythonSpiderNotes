    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:As this 92d Congress begins its session, America has lost a great Senator,\nand all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a loyal friend. I\nhad the privilege of visiting Senator Russell in the hospital just a few\ndays before he died. He never spoke about himself. He only spoke eloquently\nabout the need for a strong national defense. In tribute to one of the most\nmagnificent Americans of all time, I respectfully ask that all those here\nwill rise in silent prayer for Senator Russell.Thank you.Mr. Speaker, before I begin my formal address, I want to use this\nopportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the rather\nspirited contest for leadership positions in the House and the Senate and,\nalso, to express my condolences to the losers. I know how both of you\nfeel.And I particularly want to join with all of the Members of the House and\nthe Senate as well in congratulating the new Speaker of the United States\nCongress.To those new Members of this House who may have some doubts about the\npossibilities for advancement in the years ahead, I would remind you that\nthe Speaker and I met just 24 years ago in this Chamber as freshmen Members\nof the 80th Congress. As you see, we both have come up in the world a bit\nsince then.Mr. Speaker, this 92d Congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatest\nCongress in America's history.In these troubled years just past, America has been going through a long\nnightmare of war and division, of crime and inflation. Even more deeply, we\nhave gone through a long, dark night of the American spirit. But now that\nnight is ending. Now we must let our spirits soar again. Now we are ready\nfor the lift of a driving dream.The people of this Nation are eager to get on with the quest for new\ngreatness. They see challenges, and they are prepared to meet those\nchallenges. It is for us here to open the doors that will set free again\nthe real greatness of this Nation--the genius of the American people.How shall we meet this challenge? How can we truly open the doors, and set\nfree the full genius of our people?The way in which the 92d Congress answers these questions will determine\nits place in history. More importantly, it can determine this Nation's\nplace in history as we enter the third century of our independence.Tonight I shall present to the Congress six great goals. I shall ask not\nsimply for more new programs in the old framework. I shall ask to change\nthe framework of government itself---to reform the entire structure of\nAmerican government so we can make it again fully responsive to the needs\nand the wishes of the American people.If we act boldly--if we seize this moment and achieve these goals--we can\nclose the gap between promise and performance in American government. We\ncan bring together the resources of this Nation and the spirit of the\nAmerican people.In discussing these great goals, I shall deal tonight only with matters on\nthe domestic side of the Nation's agenda. I shall make a separate report to\nthe Congress and the Nation next month on developments in foreign policy.The first of these great goals is already before the Congress.I urge that the unfinished business of the 91st Congress be made the first\npriority business of the 92d Congress.Over the next 2 weeks, I will call upon Congress to take action on more\nthan 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completed\nlast year.The most important is welfare reform.The present welfare system has become a monstrous, consuming outrage--an\noutrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and particularly\nagainst the children it is supposed to help.We may honestly disagree, as we do, on what to do about it. But we can all\nagree that we must meet the challenge, not by pouring more money into a bad\nprogram, but by abolishing the present welfare system and adopting a new\none.So let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in\nAmerica--and without those demeaning, soul-stifling affronts to human\ndignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today. But let us also\nestablish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement.Let us provide the means by which more can help themselves. This shall be\nour goal.Let us generously help those who are not able to help themselves. But let\nus stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to do so.The second great goal is to achieve what Americans have not enjoyed since\n1957--full prosperity in peacetime.The tide of inflation has turned. The rise in the cost of living, which had\nbeen gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties, was reduced last\nyear. Inflation will be further reduced this year.But as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price\nstability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime\neconomy to a peacetime economy, we have paid a price in increased\nunemployment.We should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in\nthis transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in any\npeacetime year of the sixties.This is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the seventies. We\nmust do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better.To achieve this, I will submit an expansionary budget this year--one that\nwill help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunities\nfor millions of Americans.It will be a full employment budget, a budget designed to be in balance if\nthe economy were operating at its peak potential. By spending as if we were\nat full employment, we will help to bring about full employment.I ask the Congress to accept these expansionary policies--to accept the\nconcept of a full employment budget. At the same time, I ask the Congress\nto cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the limits of the\nfull employment budget. For as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely\nshared prosperity, we must not reignite the fires of inflation and so\nundermine that prosperity.With the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget, with the\ncommitment of the independent Federal Reserve System to provide fully for\nthe monetary needs of a growing economy, and with a much greater effort on\nthe part of labor and management to make their wage and price decisions in\nthe light of the national interest and their own self-interest--then for\nthe worker, the farmer, the consumer, for Americans everywhere we shall\ngain the goal of a new prosperity: more jobs, more income, more profits,\nwithout inflation and without war.This is a great goal, and one that we can achieve together.The third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun last\nyear: to restore and enhance our natural environment.Building on the foundation laid in the 37-point program that I submitted to\nCongress last year, I will propose a strong new set of initiatives to clean\nup our air and water, to combat noise, and to preserve and restore our\nsurroundings.I will propose programs to make better use of our land, to encourage a\nbalanced national growth--growth that will revitalize our rural heartland\nand enhance the quality of life in America.And not only to meet today's needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow, I\nwill put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a President of\nthe United States to expand the Nation's parks, recreation areas, open\nspaces, in a way that truly brings parks to the people where the people\nare. For only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next generation have\nparks to enjoy.As a fourth great goal, I will offer a far-reaching set of proposals for\nimproving America's health care and making it available more fairly to more\npeople.I will propose:--A program to insure that no American family will be prevented from\nobtaining basic medical care by inability to pay.--I will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical\nschools, to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health\npersonnel.--Incentives to improve the delivery of health services, to get more\nmedical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately\nserved, to make greater use of medical assistants, and to slow the alarming\nrise in the costs of medical care.--New programs to encourage better preventive medicine, by attacking the\ncauses of disease and injury, and by providing incentives to doctors to\nkeep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick.I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch an\nintensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later for\nwhatever additional funds can effectively be used. The time has come in\nAmerica when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and\ntook man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.\nLet us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal.America has long been the wealthiest nation in the world. Now it is time we\nbecame the healthiest nation in the world.The fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our State and local\ngovernments.As we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976, we remember that this Nation\nlaunched itself as a loose confederation of separate States, without a\nworkable central government. At that time, the mark of its leaders' vision\nwas that they quickly saw the need to balance the separate powers of the\nStates with a government of central powers.And so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers, of unity with\ndiversity--and so clear was their vision that it survives today as the\noldest written constitution still in force in the world.For almost two centuries since--and dramatically in the 1930's--at those\ngreat turning points when the question has been between the States and the\nFederal Government, that question has been resolved in favor of a stronger\ncentral Federal Government.During this time the Nation grew and the Nation prospered. But one thing\nhistory tells us is that no great movement goes in the same direction\nforever. Nations change, they adapt, or they slowly die.The time has now come in America to reverse the flow of power and resources\nfrom the States and communities to Washington, and start power and\nresources flowing back from Washington to the States and communities and,\nmore important, to the people all across America.The time has come for a new partnership between the Federal Government and\nthe States and localities--a partnership in which we entrust the States and\nlocalities with a larger share of the Nation's responsibilities, and in\nwhich we share our Federal revenues with them so that they can meet those\nresponsibilities.To achieve this goal, I propose to the Congress tonight that we enact a\nplan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept.All across America today, States and cities are confronted with a financial\ncrisis. Some have already been cutting back on essential services---for\nexample, just recently San Diego and Cleveland cut back on trash\ncollections. Most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the one\nhand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other.As one indication of the rising costs of local government, I discovered the\nother day that my home town of Whittier, California--which has a population\nof 67,000--has a larger budget for 1971 than the entire Federal budget was\nin 1791.Now the time has come to take a new direction, and once again to introduce\na new and more creative balance to our approach to government.So let us put the money where the needs are. And let us put the power to\nspend it where the people are.I propose that the Congress make a $16 billion investment in renewing\nState and local government. Five billion dollars of this will be in new and\nunrestricted funds to be used as the States and localities see fit. The\nother $11 billion will be provided by allocating $1 billion of new funds\nand converting one-third of the money going to the present narrow-purpose\naid programs into Federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposes--for\nurban development, rural development, education, transportation, job\ntraining, and law enforcement--but with the States and localities making\ntheir own decisions on how it should be spent within each category.For the next fiscal year, this would increase total Federal aid to the\nStates and localities more than 25 percent over the present level.The revenue sharing proposals I send to the Congress will include the\nsafeguards against discrimination that accompany all other Federal funds\nallocated to the States. Neither the President nor the Congress nor the\nconscience of this Nation can permit money which comes from all the people\nto be used in a way which discriminates against some of the people.The Federal Government will still have a large and vital role to play in\nachieving our national progress. Established functions that are clearly and\nessentially Federal in nature will still be performed by the Federal\nGovernment. New functions that need to be sponsored or performed by the\nFederal Government--such as those I have urged tonight in welfare and\nhealth--will be added to the Federal agenda. Whenever it makes the best\nsense for us to act as a whole nation, the Federal Government should and\nwill lead the way. But where States or local governments can better do what\nneeds to be done, let us see that they have the resources to do it there.Under this plan, the Federal Government will provide the States and\nlocalities with more money and less interference--and by cutting down the\ninterference the same amount of money will go a lot further.Let us share our resources.Let us share them to rescue the States and localities from the brink of\nfinancial crisis.Let us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escape\nfrom ever-higher property taxes and sales taxes.Let us share our resources for two other reasons as well.The first of these reasons has to do with government itself, and the second\nhas to do with each of us, with the individual.Let's face it. Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at\nall levels. They will not--and they should not--continue to tolerate the\ngap between promise and performance in government.The fact is that we have made the Federal Government so strong it grows\nmuscle-bound and the States and localities so weak they approach\nimpotence.If we put more power in more places, we can make government more creative\nin more places. That way we multiply the number of people with the ability\nto make things happen--and we can open the way to a new burst of creative\nenergy throughout America.The final reason I urge this historic shift is much more personal, for each\nand for every one of us.As everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in America, as\nthe forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and more\nimpersonal, a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land.Whether it is the workingman who feels neglected, the black man who feels\noppressed, or the mother concerned about her children, there has been a\ngrowing feeling that \"Things are in the saddle, and ride mankind.\"Millions of frustrated young Americans today are crying out--asking not\nwhat will government do for me, but what can I do, how can I contribute,\nhow can I matter?And so let us answer them. Let us say to them and let us say to all\nAmericans, \"We hear you. We will give you a chance. We are going to give\nyou a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect your\nfuture--a chance to participate in government--because we are going to\nprovide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference that\nyou can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole\ncommunity.\"The further away government is from people, the stronger government becomes\nand the weaker people become. And a nation with a strong government and a\nweak people is an empty shell.I reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington, D.C., is\ninevitably more wise, more honest, and more efficient than government at\nthe local or State level. The honesty and efficiency of government depends\non people. Government at all levels has good people and bad people. And the\nway to get more good people into government is to give them more\nopportunity to do good things.The idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows best what is best\nfor people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is really\na contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves. This notion\nis completely foreign to the American experience. Local government is the\ngovernment closest to the people, it is most responsive to the individual\nperson. It is people's government in a far more intimate way than the\nGovernment in Washington can ever be.People came to America because they wanted to determine their own future\nrather than to live in a country where others determined their future for\nthem.What this change means is that once again in America we are placing our\ntrust in people.I have faith in people. I trust the judgment of people. Let us give the\npeople of America a chance, a bigger voice in deciding for themselves those\nquestions that so greatly affect their lives.The sixth great goal is a complete reform of the Federal Government\nitself.Based on a long and intensive study with the aid of the best advice\nobtainable, I have concluded that a sweeping reorganization of the\nexecutive branch is needed if the Government is to keep up with the times\nand with the needs of the people.I propose, therefore, that we reduce the present 12 Cabinet Departments to\neight.I propose that the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, and Justice\nremain, but that all the other departments be consolidated into four: Human\nResources, Community Development, Natural Resources, and Economic\nDevelopment.Let us look at what these would be:--First, a department dealing with the concerns of people--as individuals,\nas members of a family--a department focused on human needs.--Second, a department concerned with the community--rural communities and\nurban communities--and with all that it takes to make a community function\nas a community.--Third, a department concerned with our physical environment, with the\npreservation and balanced use of those great natural resources on which our\nNation depends.--And fourth, a department concerned with our prosperity--with our jobs,\nour businesses, and those many activities that keep our economy running\nsmoothly and well.Under this plan, rather than dividing up our departments by narrow\nsubjects, we would organize them around the great purposes of government.\nRather than scattering responsibility by adding new levels of bureaucracy,\nwe would focus and concentrate the responsibility for getting problems\nsolved.With these four departments, when we have a problem we will know where to\ngo--and the department will have the authority and the resources to do\nsomething about it.Over the years we have added departments and created agencies at the\nFederal level, each to serve a new constituency, to handle a particular\ntask--and these have grown and multiplied in what has become a hopeless\nconfusion of form and function.The time has come to match our structure to our purposes---to look with a\nfresh eye, to organize the Government by conscious, comprehensive design to\nmeet the new needs of a new era.One hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln stood on a battlefield and spoke of\na \"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\" Too often\nsince then, we have become a nation of the Government, by the Government,\nfor the Government.By enacting these reforms, we can renew that principle that Lincoln stated\nso simply and so well.By giving everyone's voice a chance to be heard, we will have government\nthat truly is of the people.By creating more centers of meaningful power, more places where decisions\nthat really count can be made, by giving more people a chance to do\nsomething, we can have government that truly is by the people.And by setting up a completely modern, functional system of government at\nthe national level, we in Washington will at last be able to provide\ngovernment that is truly for the people.I realize that what I am asking is that not only the executive branch in\nWashington but that even this Congress will have to change by giving up\nsome of its power.Change is hard. But without change there can be no progress. And for each\nof us the question then becomes, not \"Will change cause me inconvenience?\"\nbut \"Will change bring progress for America?\"Giving up power is hard. But I would urge all of you, as leaders of this\ncountry, to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history are\nthose who gave power to people, and not those who took it away.As we consider these reforms we will be acting, not for the next 2 years or\nfor the next 10 years, but for the next 100 years.So let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of this\nmoment in history but also of history itself.Let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the\nboldness and the courage of those great Americans who met in Philadelphia\nalmost 190 years ago to write a constitution.Let us leave a heritage as they did--not just for our children but for\nmillions yet unborn--of a nation where every American will have a chance\nnot only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to\nparticipate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes but\nhis ideas count--a system of government which will provide the means for\nAmerica to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before.Those men who met at Philadelphia left a great heritage because they had a\nvision--not only of what the Nation was but of what it could become.As I think of that vision, I recall that America was founded as the land of\nthe open door--as a haven for the oppressed, a land of opportunity, a place\nof refuge, of hope.When the first settlers opened the door of America three and a half\ncenturies ago, they came to escape persecution and to find opportunity--and\nthey left wide the door of welcome for others to follow.When the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence almost two centuries\nago, they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of human\nfulfillment--not just for an elite but for all.To the generations that followed, America's was the open door that beckoned\nmillions from the old world to the new in search of a better life, a freer\nlife, a fuller life, and in which, by their own decisions, they could shape\ntheir own destinies.For the black American, the Indian, the Mexican-American, and for those\nothers in our land who have not had an equal chance, the Nation at last has\nbegun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal\nopportunity, and of human dignity.For all Americans, with these changes I have proposed tonight we can open\nthe door to a new era of opportunity. We can open the door to full and\neffective participation in the decisions that affect their lives. We can\nopen the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels, between\nthose governments and the people themselves. And by so doing, we can open\nwide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in America\nnow and in the years to come.In the next few weeks I will spell out in greater detail the way I propose\nthat we achieve these six great goals. I ask this Congress to be\nresponsive. If it is, then the 92d Congress, your Congress, our Congress,\nat the end of its term, will be able to look back on a record more splendid\nthan any in our history.This can be the Congress that helped us end the longest war in the Nation's\nhistory, and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance to\nenjoy what we have not had in this century: a full generation of peace.This can be the Congress that helped achieve an expanding economy, with\nfull employment and without inflation--and without the deadly stimulus of\nwar.This can be the Congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbed\nrecipients of their dignity and robbed States and cities of their\nresources.This can be the Congress that pressed forward the rescue of our\nenvironment, and established for the next generation an enduring legacy of\nparks for the people.This can be the Congress that launched a new era in American medicine, in\nwhich the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were made\nless burdensome.But above all, what this Congress can be remembered for is opening the way\nto a new American revolution--a peaceful revolution in which power was\nturned back to the people--in which government at all levels was refreshed\nand renewed and made truly responsive. This can be a revolution as\nprofound, as far-reaching, as exciting as that first revolution almost 200\nyears ago--and it can mean that just 5 years from now America will enter\nits third century as a young nation new in spirit, with all the vigor and\nthe freshness with which it began its first century.My colleagues in the Congress, these are great goals. They can make the\nsessions of this Congress a great moment for America. So let us pledge\ntogether to go forward together--by achieving these goals to give America\nthe foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the years to\ncome, and in so doing to make this the greatest Congress in the history of\nthis great and good country.",
