## Running SeleniumBase Scripts

(NOTE: If you didn't install SeleniumBase properly, these scripts won't work. Installation steps include "``pip install seleniumbase``" and/or "``python setup.py install``" from the top-level directory.)

To makes things easier, here's a simple GUI program that allows you to kick off a few example scripts by pressing a button:

```bash
python gui_test_runner.py
```

(NOTE: With the exception of [my_first_test.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/my_first_test.py), which should pass, many other tests in this folder fail on purpose to demonstrate features such as screenshots on failure, exception logging, and test reports.)

If you run scripts with logging enabled, (using ``--with-testing_base``), you’ll see two folders appear: “latest_logs” and “archived_logs”. The “latest_logs” folder will contain log files from the most recent test run, but logs will only be created if the test run is failing. Afterwards, logs from the “latest_logs” folder will get pushed to the “archived_logs” folder if you have have the ``ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS`` feature enabled in [settings.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/config/settings.py). Make sure to run ``python setup.py install`` for your changes to take effect if you make any changes to that file.

**For running scripts the usual way, here are some of the example run commands:**
(Note: You can replace ``nosetests`` with ``py.test`` for most of these.)

Run the example test in Chrome:
```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=chrome
```

Run the example test in Firefox:
```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=firefox
```

Run the example test in PhantomJS:
```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=phantomjs
```

Run the example test in Demo Mode (runs slower and adds highlights):
```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --browser=chrome --with-selenium --demo_mode
```

Run the example test suite in Chrome and generate an html report: (nosetests-only)
```bash
nosetests my_test_suite.py --with-selenium --browser=chrome --with-testing_base --report
```

Run the example test suite in Firefox and generate an html report: (nosetests-only)
```bash
nosetests my_test_suite.py --with-selenium --browser=firefox --with-testing_base --report
```

Run the example test suite in PhantomJS and generate an html report: (nosetests-only)
```bash
nosetests my_test_suite.py --with-selenium --browser=phantomjs --with-testing_base --report
```

Run a test with configuration specifed by a config file:
```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --config=example_config.cfg
```

Run a test demonstrating the use of Python decorators available:
```bash
nosetests rate_limiting_test.py
```

Run a failing test with pdb mode enabled: (If a test failure occurs, test enters pdb mode)
```bash
nosetests test_fail.py --browser=chrome --with-selenium --pdb --pdb-failures
```

Run a failing test with logging:
```bash
nosetests test_fail.py --browser=chrome --with-selenium --with-testing_base --with-basic_test_info --with-page_source --with-screen_shots
```

(NOTE: If you see any ``*.pyc`` files appear as you run tests, that's perfectly normal. Compiled bytecode is a natural result of running Python code.)
