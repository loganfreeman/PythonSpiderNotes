The log files you see here were generated when test_fail.py ran and failed. You can expect to see similar logs for your tests/scripts if they run and fail when you have logging turned on (usage: —-with-testing_base). See the main ReadMe.md for more details. (With nosetests, you’ll want to add each of the following options separately: -—with-screenshots, —-with-page_source, and —-with-basic_test_info. With pytest, you’ll only need —-with-testing_base to have all of those log options turned on.)

Expected Log Files:
basic_test_info.txt
page_source.html
